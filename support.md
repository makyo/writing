Howdy!

I've been writing for years now. I still have some stuff from high school that I rather like. The style and technique needs work, obviously --- that was thirteen years ago! --- but I still think it's worth something.

Lately, I've been trying to ramp up the role that writing plays in my life. It's a load of fun, but it's also something I care deeply about. I've been doing this by, obviously, writing more, but also by editing and publishing works by others.

It's something I love doing regardless of compensation, but it's also something that I'd like to make a bigger part of my life. I have a stable job, but I also want to get into doing more work around writing, and to do so, it would be super helpful to get a bit of help from those who enjoy my writing!

I have a few mechanisms for support:

* [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/makyo) --- I have this set up as a per-creation support, rather than a monthly. That might change, but for now, it's super useful for me and really easy on patrons. We all have dry-spells, after all, and I'm no exception. I have a few support levels:
    * $1 --- Behind the Scenes: get a patron-only perspective on my work with blog posts, polls, and early access.
    * $5 --- Draft Insider: all the above, plus access to early drafts.
    * $10 --- All Access: all the above, plus access to crazy things like notes, sketches, images, etc.
    * $15 --- Guide Me: all the above, plus a say in what I write. Suggest stories, give me characters, edit my stuff for me!
* [**Gratipay**](https://gratipay.com/makyo/) --- Gratipay works more like a tip system, but it also allows users to pledge on a schedule. The benefit of this is that it's super lightweight, and also works well with GitHub.
* [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/drabmakyo) --- Ko-fi is another tipping site, and is nicely integrated with PayPal. It's also got a bit of a friendlier interface than Gratipay, one that folks are more used to.

If you're interested in supporting my writing work (and development work, if that's your bag!), I will be eternally grateful!
