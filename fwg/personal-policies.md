title: Makyo's FWG President Policies
---

My personal policies while acting as Guild president:

* I'll never lead with an opinion without being explicit about it --- I'll posit discussions, implement tooling, and, if I come up with an idea, I'll state such.
* I lead the guild, not individuals --- Moderation is the task of the moderators. While I'll be the final arbiter on decisions regarding members, it is up to moderators to handle the interactions of individuals. I'm a president, not a mom.
* My interactions as a guild member (writing, web dev, etc.) are separate from my role as president.

These are just my policies, natch, not Guild policies/guidelines/etc.
