### Rob Baird

I think what I love best about this is it's style. You do a really good job with the characters, and with the scenario, but you also write about the setup itself in this fascinating, almost journalistic way. It treads a wonderful path between intimacy and the objective, semidetached tone of voice of a separate reporter in a way that, honestly, makes it feel even more real and genuine.

I'm not sure I've really gotten that feeling before. The parentheticals and the offhand, casual way you introduce the setting that makes it feel natural at the same time as it tells the reader what's going on frame the character drama beautifully. The whole thing just has this gorgeous, lit-mag aesthetic that makes me think a lot of... well, honestly, somewhere between Hunter S Thompson and David Foster Wallace except more heartfelt along with the debauchery.

And that ending line. Argh `;_;`

### Crimson Ruairi

This was an enjoyable read -- both getting inside the sub's head and watching the couple's interplay, along with the sort of detached details about the party's mechanics. I also enjoyed the way you addressed the interspecies relationship mechanics wrt breeding. Very nice.

### Harry

BDSM doesn't really press my buttons at all but I really liked this piece. Possibly because of all the looks behind the curtain you offer.
