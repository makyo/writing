Lee,

Roses are red,  
violets are blue;  
it's been almost two years  
and I still miss you.

Roses are red,  
violets are blue;  
I'm almost ashamed to admit,  
I've started dating someone new.

Roses are red,  
violets are blue;  
her name's Anna, and you'll be pleased to know  
she's nothing like you.

Roses are red,  
violets are blue;  
Only the other night,  
we finally said "I love you".  

Roses are red,  
violets are blue;  
don't worry, it's completely different,  
it's completely new.

Alright, miss prissy whiskers, I can't keep that up, sorry! I promised I'd only write you on on your birthday, but I just wanted to say that. I'm moving on, slowly, but I'm still here. I love you, I miss you.

Crazy face
