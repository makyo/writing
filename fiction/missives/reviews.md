### HEAT editorial staff

Dear Madison Scott-Clary,

Thank you for submitting "Missives" to Heat. Unfortunately, after having reviewed all the submissions, we must inform you that yours was not chosen to be published in the next volume.

We were very happy to see a story designed not only to be short, but also to make use of an interesting letter-based format. The somber and quiet nature was a welcome change of pace. However, the story as told felt like many stories we had seen before, and the letter format wasn't adding to it. The ending, as well, fell a bit flat to many of the reviewers.

We receive many submissions each year to Heat, and only have room for a few. We wish you the best of luck in finding a home for it.

-Heat Editorial Staff
