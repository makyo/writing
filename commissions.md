### Commission status: *Open*{: style="color: green"}

![Typing! For you!](/assets/typing.jpg)

Do you have an idea that you would like put to paper? Sweet!

Do you like my writing? Yay, thank you!

Do you want to combine those two into a story commission? Let's talk.

### How it works

1. You [get in touch with me](http://makyo.io/contact) and let me know what you're looking for and at what length, from 2,000 to 12,000 words. Any longer and we'll need to have a more in-depth conversation.
2. If it's something I'm interested in and can fit in (I do work a day job, after all), I'll let you know, and we can start hammering out details. You'll pay the first half of the price here.
3. Provide as much or as little detail as you want. Here are some examples:
    * If you want to suggest characters or even use your own, feel free to send visual or textual refs.
    * If you have plot ideas, let me know (but understand that I may bend them some). For example, if you want some story to go with your RPG campaign, or you want more stories featuring your kink, or you want a chat log re-cast as a story...the sky's the limit.
    * If you have a name in mind, sweet.
    * If you want to go with less and give me more freedom to work, I love doing that, too!
4. I'll send you a draft and we can go over it for any changes. After this point, I won't accept any further changes.
5. You'll soon get an edited, final version. At this point, only emergency changes may be made. You'll pay the second half of the price here.

### What it costs

I use a rough hourly guide for my rates of about $12/hr, but I knock some off as the length increases. I'll try to give a round number.

Here's *usually* how this works out:

Wordcount | Hours | Fee
---|---|---
2,000 | 4 | $50
5,000 | 8--9 | $100
10,000 | 20 | $200

Keep in mind that these are just rough guidelines of numbers. Your story may cost more or less, depending on content, difficulty, etc. I'll provide you with a timecard if you'd like.

### How long it takes

Although I provide some rough hours above, that does not mean you'll get your story in that number of hours. I take regular breaks after some carpal tunnel trouble, I work a dayjob, I live with my partner and dogs, etc. Needless to say, I'll get you your story as soon as possible. A good guideline would be that I can work about two hours a day, so *4 hours ⇒ 2 days*, *8 hours ⇒ 4 days*, etc.

### What you get and what I keep

You get a story written to your specifications. You may print and post this wherever, whenever, *so long as it's attributed to me.* These are the only rights you have. You may not publish or sell the story.

I retain all remaining rights, including copyright, posting rights (though you can ask me to take it down), and publication rights (though I'll never publish something with your characters in it, and should such a piece get published, it will come with a dedication to you).

### What I will and won't write

Here are some things I love:

* Coming of age
* Coming out
* Sci-fi
* Mental health stories
* Trans and NB characters

Here are some things I'm not sure I'd write too well, but am willing to give it a go:

* Fantasy (esp. high fantasy, I'm better with urban fantasy/magical realism)
* Alternate history (esp. steampunk)
* Sports

Here are some things I won't--

You know, I actually have a whole writeup about what I won't write [here](http://hybrid.ink/nope/), including the caveat that some of these things can be justified by the story. There may be some things this cuts out that might be of interest to folks I commission, but I must apologize, this isn't something I can compromise on.
