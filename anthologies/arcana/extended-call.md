title: <em>Arcana</em> - Extended Call for Submissions
---

<div class="alert alert-danger">Submissions for the extended call are <strong>not yet open</strong>. Keep an eye out for more information!</div>

In November of 2016, a conversation in the Furry Writers' Guild around the archetypes involved in the major arcana of the Tarot turned into an idea for an anthology. That idea was soon turned to reality after Thurston Howl Publications picked up the anthology for publishing. That led to a call for submissions, which closed on March 31, 2017.

The outcome was, frankly, staggering. We received 28 submissions plus eight solicited submissions. In addition, we've allowed seven short-term extensions on an individual basis. This is all quite impressive when one considers that such an anthology isn't *one* call for submissions, but *twenty-two*. After all, we needed submissions for each of the twenty-two cards. We alleviated some of this through solicited submissions for specific cards.

The result that we achieved was fairly even. Some cards naturally picked up more submissions, while others less so. In most cases, enough submissions were received to make an editorial decision fair, but a few cards were stretched too thin to make a final decision legitimate.

### *Arcana* is open for an extended call for submissions

With so many wonderful authors out there, we invite you to write stories based around the archetypes driving a subset of the tarot's major arcana. Several of the cards are open for additional submissions. For more details on the anthology's requirements and restrictions, please see the [original call](..).

Much like the first call, this call will involve some feedback to you, the authors, as to what cards are receiving attention, and which ones are not. This will be much simpler, however. Just a number of submissions received with no upper limit on the number available.

This extended call applies to the following cards:

Card | Meaning | Submissions
---|---|---
The Empress | Fertility, femininity, beauty, nature, abundance *or* blocked creativity, over-dependence on others. | 2
The Lovers | Love, union, relationships, values alignment, choices *or* disharmony, imbalance, misalignment of values. | 0
Strength | Strength, courage, patience, control, compassion *or* weakness, self-doubt, lack of self-discipline. | 2
The Devil | Bondage to one's ideals, addiction, sexuality, materialism *or* detachment, breaking free, power reclaimed. | 2
The Star | Hope, spirituality, renewal, inspiration, serenity *or* lack of faith, despair discouragement. | 2
Judgement | Judgement, rebirth, inner calling, absolution *or* self doubt, refusal of self-examination. | 1

Further details are on the [original call](..), but here is a quick rundown:

Submission length
:   2,000--5,000 words

Submission rating
:   G-R (mention of sex or violence is okay, but should not be the focus of the story)

Payment
:   &frac12; cent per word

Previous publication
:   Previously published stories not currently under contract allowed

Multiple submissions
:   With the anthology, yes; within each card, no. *This includes cards you have submitted to in the first round*

How to submit
:   Email submissions to makyo.thurstonhowlpub+arcana@gmail.com. Submissions should include a cover letter stating which card you chose and why. Submission files (doc, docx, odt, tex, txt, markdown, pdf...ask if you have concerns) should be anonymized.

**The call for submissions will close on May 5, 2017.**

Good luck, write well!

### But wait, I have some questions!

Why are you opening for X card?
:   I want three submissions or more per card so that a decision can be a fair choice, and not simply "which is the better of two stories".

I submitted to X card before this call opened! Will my submission be treated fairly?
:   Yes. As all submissions are (or should be!) anonymous, I won't know who submitted what. The deciding factor on re-opening for these cards is a game of numbers; I have *not yet read* any submissions. That means that I'm not simply re-opening for cards which received submissions I didn't like or anything! I will slush submissions for these cards after opening for this call, but will review all submissions for these cards *when this call ends*.

I have an outstanding extension on one of these card. Will that be affected by the call?
:   No. Or, rather, you now have more time! Take the time you have now to make sure your story is wonderful.

I wrote for card X, and I'm still worried about this extended call. Doesn't that mean I have less of a chance?
:   In a way, it does. However, I need more than two submissions to make a fair choice for a card. Editor's prerogative.

What is your favorite card?
:   The Fool :)

What is your favorite pasta dish?
:   Get to writing! (It's *cacio e pepe*.)
