title: Major arcana cards and meanings for Arcana
---

[&larr; Back to the call for submissions page](..)

The major arcana, followed from the first card to the last, tell a story of growth and fulfillment.  The meanings can be strung together to form a coherent plot, as [many have noticed](http://www.learntarot.com/journey.htm).  When writing a submission for a card, you are writing a self-contained story, of course - there is no shared universe or characters required - but you're also writing a story focusing on a character or characters as they experience the part in a journey that the card signifies.

### The cards

In many common Tarot readings, cards are shuffled to mix them up.  In the process, some cards wind up being drawn upside down, or *reversed*.  Thus, each card comes with two meanings: the meaning for when the card is drawn upright, and the meaning for when the card is drawn reversed.  These two meanings are two sides of the same coin, the reversed meaning often implying an impeded, restricted, or subverted reading of the primary meaning.  Both meanings are provided below - you may focus on the primary or the reversed meaning, or simply the underlying archetype, in your submission.

If you're going to work on a story for one of the major arcana cards, please let us know and we'll update the call for submissions with how many pledges are outstanding on a card to let other writers know.  ~~You can let us know on the Google Form available here~~ The pledge period is now over.
