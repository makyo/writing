The Tarot has been with us for centuries.  Reports of Tarot itself go back to the early 1400s, and the act of using the cards as divinatory tools was documented in the mid 1700s.  Since then, the idea of using cards for divination has figured large in western society.  They inspire words of praise as well as derision, works of art and imitation and parody, and words upon countless words.

With how much the Tarot has woven itself into society, it's no small wonder that the cards are so well known, and the archetypes they represent can feel so universal.  Each one seems to tell its own story...

### Call for Submissions

*Arcana* is an anthology of furry fiction edited by Makyo and published by [Thurston Howl Publications](http://thurstonhowlpublications.com/).  Twenty-two submissions for each of the twenty-two major arcana cards.  Each card suggests a theme, and each submission should expand on that theme through a character-driven plot.  The challenge for the author will be to come up with a story that showcases the ideas behind their card in a relatively short span.  The challenge for the editors will be to find stories that create an anthology that is diverse enough to enjoy while still being cohesive enough to be able to read from cover to cover.

Thankfully, the Major Arcana - the first 22 cards of the Tarot deck - already tell a story of growth and fulfillment on their own.  We just need some lovely words from some lovely authors!

Howl, [Nov 27, 2016, 2:32 PM]:
1. Try to get at least eight set authors to commit to eight of the cards, that will be closed to other submissions. And try to have these eight well spread throughout the anthology, especially the first and last card.

2. Have an open call for the others. Don't do the three slots thing, but do give names of who has submitted under each one as well as who is planning on writing one, so people can still go for underdog cards.

3. Don't say this in the call for subs, but assume that we will have a second call for subs. In the likely case that there will be a few cards that have zero quality subs.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 27, 2016, 2:38 PM]:
For part 3, will we send out accept/reject letters before the second call?

Howl, [Nov 27, 2016, 2:39 PM]:
Yes, we will.

They will ask for a deadline. Let's say March 15th?

OH, and please keep me as up to date as possible on this. When you get a confirmation, let me know immediately.

Once you get eight who say they will do it, then you can post the call for four months past when you get the eighth confirmation.

Definitely try to get Kyell if you can.

Haha

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 27, 2016, 2:46 PM]:
*nod* I'm already forming a list, hah.  Kyell, Sparf, Searska (who sounded very interested), maybe Ryffnah

Okay!

Howl:
Talked with Ocean, discussed possibly having more than eight solicited authors. Let's go for at least eleven.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:03 PM]:
Anyway, the reason I got confused last night was because I had been thinking about asking authors for invite cards to write for more than one card.  Like, The Fool, Wheel of Fortune, and The World tell a definite story together, so I was going to ask one author to do all three; one world, same characters, three chapters.  There's a few other pairings and such, too, like The Empress and The Emperor.  Does that sound doable?

Howl, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:03 PM]:
Hm....

Point number one: [nitpicky] Don't put two spaces between sentences. We haven't done that as a society in...sixty years?

Point number two: In theory that sounds nice, but I don't think it's practical to ask any author to do more than one story.

A suggestion might be to commit different authors for those cards, but have them play off each other's stories.

For example, give "The Fool" a much earlier due date, and then give it to the author of the next story, and so on.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:05 PM]:
*nod* That makes sense (and yeah, sorry, I've been trying for _years_ to break the double spacing habit x.x)

Howl, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:05 PM]:
Haha, xP

Sorry about that. I'm a word folf. It's what I do.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:06 PM]:
I have macros in my text editor to remove that, even. Bleh, dumb typing classes. Anyway!

Howl, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:07 PM]:
Haha. So do you think that idea would work?

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 28, 2016, 3:11 PM]:
Yeah, definitely! I guess the thing that was kinda making me anxious last night was thinking of 11 authors to invite without exhausting the active authors in the guild. That's what drove me to think about letting authors tackle multiple cards in a longer submission.

Howl, [Nov 28, 2016, 8:24 PM]:
Hmm I don't know. I think single subs would be better than multiple for authors but that's up to you and how your negotiations go

Madison Scott-Clary, [Nov 28, 2016, 8:25 PM]:
*nod*  That's fine :3  I still need to do some talking to figure it out.  I was going to allow multiple submisisons for open cards, but probably only publish one per author unless submissions are scant.  Does that sound okay?

Howl:
Deal :)

### Resources

Tarot is popular, and has been for centuries.  As such, there's a wealth of information to inspire you and perhaps offer some more information about what the cards indicate and the feelings they inspire:

* A good starter Tarot deck that is easy both on the eyes and wallet is the Universal Waite deck.  The Rider-Waite-Smith deck is the one that most folks think of when they think of Tarot, and the Universal Waite deck is a recoloring that helps make things a little easier to look at.  It's available on [Amazon](http://a.co/dlPDuyt) and from other fine retailers.
* [Aeclectic Tarot](http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/) is a website and forum dedicated to exploring the Tarot, various Tarot decks, and the reading of the cards.
* *78 Degrees of Wisdom* by Rachal Pollack is a wonderful book which walks through the Tarot deck in order from start to finish, major and minor arcana both, in exhaustive detail, while still remaining personable and enjoyable to read.  It's available on [Amazon](http://a.co/6PKbLYD) and from other booksellers, and a review is [available on Aeclectic](http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/books/78-degrees-of-wisdom/).
