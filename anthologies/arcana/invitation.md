title: Invitation for closed cards
---

Hi there, Makyo here!

As the anthology moved forward from an idea, it became clear that getting a fair distribution of submissions across all of the available cards was actually going to be pretty difficult. I started with a few ideas on how to help this out with a lot of help from way more experienced folks. After a lot of discussion with Thurston Howl, the publisher, we've settled on a process that will hopefully help out here.

There are 22 cards in the major arcana, so 11 of them will be open submissions, meaning that anyone seeing the call will be able to submit stories for those cards. The other 11 will be invite only, meaning I will seek out authors and harangue them into writing about a card. Additionally, although multiple submissions will be accepted for the open cards, the invite-only cards will each have a different author.

The goals of this are two-fold:

* We'll be more likely to get a submission for every card without begging, and
* We'll get a bunch more consistency, as the invite cards are scattered throughout the majors.

Anyway, that's the deal! This info is part of that invitation, so everyone's on the same page. Here's how it's looking so far:

Card | Author(s) | Notes
---|---|---
The Fool | |  
The High Priestess | buni (complete)| *Asked if the high priestess, if personified in the story, needs to be a cis woman, which it doesn't; this applies to all cards.*
Wheel of Fortune | |  
Justice | Searska (complete) |  
The Hanged Man | |  
The Star | |  
The Moon | Kyell |  
The Sun | George Squares |  
The World | Ryffnah |  

Also talked to but haven't decided on a card: *Sparf*.

The intentionally-vague definitions I'm nudging people towards, if they don't have any in their heads already, are available [here](../cards), but there are a ton more ways to look at the archetypes involved in each. Good luck, and keep in touch! I'm looking forward at seeing what folks come up with
