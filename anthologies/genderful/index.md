title: Genderful - an anthropomorphic anthology about gender
---

As furries, we base large swaths of our identity around species. We search for what fits, we let our species choose us, and find ways to be happy as such.

Species isn't the only portion of identity that we explore within this subculture, though; given the relative safety of our community, gender is also something that we frequently explore. More than 8% of furries describe themselves as non-cisgender, and a further 6% describe their gender as 'complicated'[^stats].

Furry is often a means of wish-fulfillment for us, the players of our characters and the bearers of our avatars, so we often present ourselves as we desire to be seen. Within a fictional furry world, though, there's little reason to expect that similar statistics around gender identity and expression would not also be the case.

How would those in a furry world explore their gender? What are the mechanics of hormone replacement therapy - transdermal patches obviously being out of the question - or of gender affirming surgery? What are the social implications of gender transition in a society already differentiated by species? How does sex and sexuality work in a setting with complex scents and sensitive noses?

***Genderful*** is a furry fiction anthology which aims to explore these questions, letting them play out over the course of 5,000-10,000 words. Though the set and setting may be tough and the plot may involve hardships, the characters should be treated with sensitivity and care. Stories may be of any rating, Adult stories and general audience stories will be offered in separate sections to allow readers to curate their experience.
