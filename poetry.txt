Beneath her coat was a whole identity:
A subtle form of ideas under soft fur,
A constantly shifting mass of meaning...
And somehow, she pulled it off.

She would go for days without shedding a thing,
And then, as if a bottle rolling off a counter,
She would shatter, sending shards of self flying,
And then we'd all see.

Then we'd all see the terror, the joy,
Then we'd all see the grief at nothing,
Then we'd all hear her say,
"I'm not built for a life with death in it."

And slowly, she'd pick herself back up
And find a brand new way to piece herself together
And build herself a brand new smile
And brush out her coat once more.

I bought my name fair and square;
Bespoke, built from whole cloth.
I wrote it again and again,
Savoring every J,
Skipping every fifth tittle,
Until it felt right,
Like sitting inside and watching the snow fall
    Through the window
Or finding the perfect way that branches in two trees
    Line up with each other
Or when the windshield wipers move
    In time with your music.

I built myself fair and square
With hands raw from coarse identity.
I kneaded and pressed and squeezed,
Savoring every curve,
Skipping every tenth day,
Until it all felt right,
Like the sweet smell of pine bark
    Rubbed between fingers
Or the whisper of maple leaves
    Under hurrying paws
Or the perfect overlap of new buds
    Already sticky with sap.
    
Used to be you and I daily would walk
through the fields out back of the house and talk
for hours, spilling words and emotions.
These walks were our daily devotions
to each other over the years.

The fields, dotted with ponds, were our space.
We tramped those trails strung like lace
along shores and through tall grass,
murmuring now like winds, chattering now like brass
in some changeful duet.

You'd tell me about the geese in the sky,
would watch me stand still and not ask why
the birds scared me to pieces,
even as we dodged around their feces
littering the trails.

You'd put up with my fickle interests,
running with me, or stopping to see what arrests
my attention. You'd follow all of my changes
and change along with me through all the ranges
of our shared experience.

You'd tell me of your meditation,
I'd talk of my fears of stagnation.
You'd always smile so kindly to me,
and I'd always feel so free
in our companionship.

And over time, those walks got slower,
shorter, less frequent, or over
far too soon, though no less meaningful
as we spent our time together in cheerful
conversation or kind quiet.

We each seemed to be going our separate ways,
with me branching out, exploring different lays
of different lands, and you turning inwards,
exploring lines of thought you never put in words,
at least not that you told me.

And then one day, we once more went out walking
and though it took a while, you got to talking.
You told me of how  you sat, quiet and alone,
waiting for the time you might turn to stone
and be completely still at last.

You told me how as you sat, the room lengthened,
curved around, turned on you --- strengthened,
it seemed, by your very presence ---
and amid all of that gathered pleasance,
bit you in half.

You told me how, as part of you died
in that moment, the rest of you spied,
it seemed, on this very ending.
You told me you thought that this rending
was the end of something big.

I listened in silence. What could I say?
The things you were telling me, walking that day
were strangely shaped and didn't make sense.
Or if they did, they did so around corners as pretense,
perhaps, subtext, allusion, metaphor.

You were right, though, I could hear it in your voice.
There was finality, there, which spoke of a choice
already made. Endings were writ on your face,
your hands, and your steps --- your very pace
spoke of completion.

I replied to that sense rather than your words.
"While you look up to the geese and see only birds,
I see omens and my doom spelled in vees.
You speak of rooms and cleaving, but please,
tell me, are you leaving?"

We'd long since stopped, there by the pond,
and your smile was, yes, sad, but still fond
as you settled down wordlessly to your knees,
took a slow breath, looked out to the trees,
and closed your eyes.

Beginnings are such delicate times
and I very nearly missed it, no chimes
to announce the hour of your leaving.
As it was, there was no time for believing
or not in the next moments.

Your fingers crawled beneath the soil
and sprouted roots, flesh starting to roil.
Coarse bark spiraled up your wrists and arms,
Spelling subtle incantations and charms
to the chaos of growth.

You bowed your head and from your crown
sprouted a tender shoot covered in fine down,
soon followed by crenelated leaves and fine stems.
The pace was fast, implacable, and leaves like gems
soon arched skyward.

You sprouted and grew, taking root
in one smooth motion, fixed and mute.
Your clothing fell away, rotting in fast-time.
Naked now, you sat still, committing one last crime
of indecency.

Your face, your face! In your face was such peace
as I'd never seen, even as you gave up this lease
on life, echoed also in my heart of hearts.
I did not cry out, nor even speak, witnessing such arts
as your final display showed.

Soon, you were consumed, transformed as a whole.
Your head a crown of leaves, your heart a bole
bored in rough bark and sturdy wood,
your fingers, knees, and toes stood
as thirsty roots.

I stood a while by the tree that was you,
then sat at your roots and thought of all I knew
about time, transformation, death and change.
I thought about you, your life, your emotional range,
your gentle apotheosis.

Then I walked home, quiet and numb.
No, not numb, per se, but perhaps dumb.
Dumb of words, dumb of emotions. Quiet.
I expected turmoil, some internal riot,
I got nullity.

Who, after all, if I cried out,
would hear my wordless shout
among the still trees and rustling leaves?
Who hears? Who cares? Who perceives
this non-grief?

You, my friend, are still there.
I walk the fields every day, passing where
you changed into something new.
I marvel at you, at how you grew
into something wholly different.

Used to be you and I daily would walk
through the fields out back of the house and talk.
Now, it's just me, alone, quiet, thinking
of you by the shore, forever drinking
of sweet water.

Too many wine-dark seas need daily traversal,
And here the shipping forecast calls for rain.

The shipping forecast! What a load of bollocks.
You can listen from start to finish
And not hear a single word about how a day will feel.

Or maybe it's a pale, tired, steganography:
Moderate, becoming poor, violent storm 11.

Burning up, drowning, torn by wind, and all I can manage
is to tell you southwest gale 8 to storm 10.

I can point at the moon, exhausted, bored, decaying,
And hope you don't stare blankly at my finger.

There's some duality between sources of meaning,
    Between the types of stories we use to back identity.
It's not quite good & bad or light & dark,
    Though I'm not yet sure just how to define it.

Dad used to punish the dogs
    by locking then in the basement.
If he was really mad,
    he'd toss then down there by the scruff.

Mom moved me & her dogs to a new house -
    moved us three days early during the divorce.
Her dog punched my ex stepdad in the crotch the night before,
    the nut-shot to end all nut-shots, & our time there.

Few things make me feel as deeply about life as parenthood,
    even if it's just me caring for my dogs.
Some reminders of that are intense enough to be raw, painful,
    salt in the wounds of mortality, maybe, or the ache of maternal love.

The meaning behind the story of me & my dogs
    comes with a story of its own, or maybe several.
It's bound up in stories to come,
    & these stories nest infinitely deep.

Remembering that & shaping that,
    It's a part of making the meaning in my life.
This isn't better against worse,
    it's not mom against dad.

It's not a dichotomy at all, really,
    now that I think about it.
It's something subtler, comfortably complex, a topic of its own.
    I guess it's just meaning & self.
        
Though the flow'r may bloom ere long
    and night recede unto the dawn,
so yet may love's embrace grow fond
    and still be spoilt upon the wan.
Brave are you and wield your smile:
    A cudgel, tool, a keen-edged blade.
You are not wan, love is not spoilt;
    thus I be slain and love not fade.
Have I any need for flow'rs?
    For nights, for dawns, for words or breath?
With so keen and fond a blade,
    There's naught to fear in life or death.
        So slay, then slay! For now, I care not how,
        I need for naught but that which love allow.

        
Though every climax approach a denouement
And every dawn a night,
Every moment worth sharing
May be worth stealing.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.

When every touch lingers as if forever
And yet seems to pass too soon,
Hearts reach out to hearts,
To seek, to aim, to keep.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.

Surely it's cruelty that need begets need begets need,
And yet need may bring pleasure.
Pleasure may hurt, ache, burn,
May steal hours of night.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.
    
I reach for the ewer of water,
I hope to quench the heat.
I beg for yet another serving,
I hope to fill my need.

The water -- cool -- cools not
Without thy merry presence.
The food fills, passes, is gone --
Yet leaves me empty, yearning.

Though the heart may quicken --
Though the tongue may lap --
I shall sup no greater meal
Than thy gift entrancing.

On reading letters late received,
I felt within: the fox --
Yelping, yowling now, crying needfully --
Myself, a craving beast.

You find me at a disadvantage --
Panting and aswish --
Would that distance be traversed as easily
As hearts t'wards yearning hearts!

A rose, single, now blooming
    may indeed bless the stem,
yet are not roses clipp'd and shown?
    Undoubted 'tis a blessing to them
who receive such a gift!
    Yet now unmade is the flow'r
which adorns thy mantle with its grace
    and withers, however slowly, by the hour,
        until 'tis faded to nothing and dust,
        though some scent remain forever amidst the must.

A rose, single, now blooming
    is perhaps best left on the stem,
its beauty to be admired amidst the growth.
    Surely 'tis better to long for that gem,
than witness beauty wilt and dry!
    Yet now one must long indeed, must burn,
Must yearn forever for that grace.
    To watch that growth, to explore stem's turn,
        day by day would destroy, weakening one by the hour,
        A rose, single, now blooming, forever holds all pow'r.

Saturday is for mechanics.
Sunday is for terror.
Monday is for acceptance.
Tuesday is for purging.
Wednesday is for anxiety.
Thursday is for sleep.

When I am asleep
The world changes around me.
In spring, I am changed.

I'm no good at images, only words,
and yet for days after surgery,
as anesthesia and countless
    milligrams, milliliters, millions of
drugs leave my system,
I'm lousy with visions,
each lousy with meaning.

I lay in bed, unable to move,
struggling to keep my eyes open;
I know that if I close them,
    I'll be lost, I'll be lost, I'll be
mired in waking dreams,
coherent visions with all the logic
of that paler side of consciousness.

Perhaps the veil here
is still too thin and vague,
the pool too clear, the monsters too scary
    too lean, too mean, too hungry, or
perhaps I was too close to death
to come away totally unscathed,
too close to completely survive.

    It's as though, laying here,
    stinking of hospital,
    I'm seeing emotions play out,
        Scene after scene, scene after scene,
    anxiety shown in heaps of discarded entrails,
    hope in the ceaseless ratcheting of gears,
    determination in the marching of feet.

If I were an artist, perhaps
I could hope to touch these images,
but as it is, every word falls short,
    too vague, too inexact, too tight to
hope to explain something so vast
by the very act of attempting to reproduce;
I can only hint from the margins.

That poetry can accomplish what prose cannot
in its economy of motion
is attractive to me, here in recovery -
    so tired, so tired, so tired - so
maybe I can hope to express the dire import
of these visions dancing behind closed lids,
or at least remind myself on rereading.

Even now, a week out,
I'm starting to lose touch with the visions,
I can almost touch them if I squint,
    lie real still, don't move now, but
even then, a shadow of the substance...
I'm starting to consign to memory
that which was probably memory to begin with.

It is two hundred miles between what I expect and what I want.
Two hundred long strides that seem impassible from one direction,
    and from the other a day's short drive.

It is nine and a half hours between question and answer.
A half hour of jazz, nine hours of sleep, a scant second of perspective,
    and I can only traverse in one direction

It is eleven inches between who I was and who I am.
Ten of those inches are pain, the eleventh is numb,
    There's pleasure to be had in there, I'm promised.

It is twelve years between what I want and what I get:
Ten years of remembering who I will become, two years running,
    Eight days dreaming.

What have you changed?
    My mind
What changed you?
    Nothing
What became of it?
    I am not who I was

What have you changed?
    My name
What changed you?
    The word
What became of it?
    I am called who I am

What have you changed?
    My looks
What changed you?
    The light
What became of it?
    I am seen as I am

What have you changed?
    My chemistry
What changed you?
    The substance
What became of it?
    My form is my own

What have you changed?
    My body
What changed you?
    The knife
What became of it?
    I am shaped how I am

What have you changed?
    Nothing
What changed you?
    I was accepted
What became of it?
    I accepted myself

What have you changed?
    Everything
What changed you?
    Everything
What became of it?
    I became who I am

    
A flash of coppery sweetness,
A clearing of the sinuses,
A burst of unnamed colors,
A rush of creativity, of wonder,
Velvety softness, a low hum,
And then the wave recedes.


Her hair is tied with a ribbon
    Saying "This is not for you."
She wears a pendant of stamped brass
    Saying "Non sum qualis eram."
"I have been a hero since birth,"
    She tells herself,
        As though that will somehow
            Explain her scars.

She pierced her own ears,
    But did a shit job of it.
Her tattoos tease around
    the edges of her identity.
Her bones are ley-lines,
    She tells herself,
        Strung with symbols
            Heady with meaning.

She has a certain "fuck you" inflected
    "Je ne sais quoi" about her.
Her clothes bespeak
    carefully constructed laziness.
"I've got my own style,"
    She tells herself,
        While doing all she can
            To not be seen.

She studied order through science
    and found it chaotic.
She studied chaos through music
    and found it inviable.
"I'll work with words."
    She tells herself
        She'll write a book,
            Or publish stories.

She wanted to be a bus driver
    when she grew up.
Then a linguist, then a biologist,
    Then a composer, a conductor.
She never wanted to be
    What she became;
        The irony of which
            Is not lost on her.

The dogs assure me:
There are volumes of meaning -
Life and death -
And time;
Past, present, future -
In the scent of a rotting fish left after the flood,
Or a trace of scat,
Or the coyote, long passed,
But not everyone reads poetry.

I'm not so lucky, all told:
The rich scent of meaning -
Heady, intoxicating -
Rises only from words
And the way you rest your hands on the table.

There is too much fire in me
to be described by the soldering iron's tip.

If I were to draw that across my flesh,
   it would all spill out at once.
I'd melt, eaten whole by flames,
    and flow into a pool of molten silver.
I would be borne up through the clouds,
    and grow lighter by the second.
Sublimation would claim me then,
    atoms would scatter, diffuse.
All that energy poured to the air around me,
    an imperceptible increase in temperature.
Particle would excite particle
    until I'm felt only as warmth on your face.

But even that would not be enough.

I keep hoping that, one day,  
I'll spring palladial from the bole of a tree.  
Fully formed, sexless,  
Conceived without desire or intent.

My body will be virginal and clean,  
My mind fresh, my soul at ease.  
The tree, behind me, will stand crooked,  
Bole seeping until time and air dry sap.

I will be a flat expanse of green, made up of new cells.  
Everything will work together, a smoothly running machine.

I keep hoping to, one day,  
Function with unity, unflagging.  
Organized and purposeful,  
Intent only on fulfillment.

My vision will be clear and unclouded,  
My will affirming, strong, and sure.  
And when I fall, I will remain whole,  
Confident that I lived well and unapologetic.

I see your past in cross-processed film,
in blown-out colors and over-saturation.

    You told me all about it, told me grand stories:
    you were going to go back in time and save the world.

I see your past in yellows and browns,
in umber and sienna and amber, in a younger sun.

    You sat and told me how &mdash; and you were always sitting &mdash;
    you thought past-you dreamt of a future less complicated than today.

I see your past through film-grain and vignette,
with a thick white border, space on the bottom to write.

    You told me how you learned so many imperfect things,
    in so many less than ideal ways, always at inopportune times.

I see your past in architectural drawings of unrealized buildings,
in paperback covers reaching towards heaven, in trillions of words.

    You figured past you dreamt of, not perfection,
    but a world unconstrained by so many failures.

I see your past with no me in it,
and wonder if past-you dreamt of us.

Resuscitating ancient coins in class, we learned,
takes a toothbrush and olive oil.
Slow, steady strokes across, around...
soft bristles dislodging soil
one speck at a time.
But no one that day was nearly as blessed,
seeing a coin shine through
at the end, full relief brightly expressed,
as I was to see you smile.

When you arrive,
the whole world gets slow.
Sluggish, amber-colored air
mellows lively conversations.
Everyone stops, marvels,
turns eagerly toward you;
and there are no complaints
about warming our faces in the sun.

We fit together in the strangest ways
and seem to seek new seams to savor.
Such joins are hardly perfect,
thread tugging fabric unevenly
unless it's reinforced over and over again.
We seem to seek new seams to savor,
and, weak though they are,
revel in the imperfect unevenness of joining.

Complementary, clashing anxieties.
Dull clamor of intersecting feelings.
Need, desire, craving, jealousy.
Worry, fear, care, prayerful fretting.
Love, lust, friendship, a need to share.
Emotions on emotions on emotions,
and, often, comfortable silence.

Tightly wound springs
Of very carefully
Not touching.
    Secret words
    To be said
    With confidence.
Rules.
Prohibitions.
Limits.
    Discussions planned,
    Side-channels arranged,
    Whiskey purchased.
And now anxiety
Over what it means
And how to work it.
    Is it worth it for
    Long-standing questions
    To be answered?
To invite disaster
For sake of knowledge
And further dreams?
    Maybe the answer
    Is that tired refrain:
    Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
And now we're
Awaiting weeks
Of careful touches.

I could never tell you
that you feel too much.
That you feel too hard,
or that your feelings
overwhelm and overtake you.

I could never tell you
how beautiful that is.
That I wish I could feel those things,
that I wish I could feel that way.

All I can tell you
is how beautiful you are
when you feel love.

Would that I had the faith
To pray daily.
Eleven months to let you go,
And an amen to end the sorrow.

When a light so far above me shines down,
I lose my footing, stop, look around,
and for once, see my way lit before me.

Through you,
    I learn how I move.
Through you,
    I see how I act.
Through you,
    I judge myself.

When a light so far above me shines down,
I turn my face to the warmth and bask,
drawing strength, assured in my steps.

Through you,
    I recognize my failings.
Through you,
    I understand my strengths.
Through you,
    I gain perspective.

When a light so far above me shines down,
I reach toward it and grasp at what I can,
hoping I might somehow gain my own luster.

Through you,
    I find my place.
Through you,
    I gain surety.
Through you,
    I learn who I am.

When a light so far above me shines down,
and I fail to shine myself,
I hope only to reflect what I can.

Every time I seek to change
my life, myself, my love, my name,
every time I try and broaden my range
in this shitty, all-encompassing game,
I hesitate.

With every change in my life
comes the terror of maybe losing you
of maybe being caught in strife
over such insecurities as few
have escaped unscathed.

That you love me still
reaffirms so many of my choices,
and I set about with a will,
ignoring querulous voices
in favor of your calm laugh.

Between our houses,
there is a simple fence -
not a chasm, not a wall.
Chain-link, waist high,
bedecked with sweet-pea
and set about with violets.
Something we can tend,
something to feel good about,
something between us
other than nothing.

I will swallow my love for you.
I will swallow my love.
I will swallow my love for you
And relish the magnesium flare,
Rejoice in immolation,
Cherish the autolysis
Of secret cells.
I will swallow my love for you.
I will swallow my love.
A year starts not on January first.
    The days may hunder but the seasons speak
of time's long march, of fast time, slow time. Thirst
    for "start" and "end" neglects the limen sleek.
So, why do some unsubtle sciences
    forget about the in-betweens? Those pure
uncolored dreams made mere contrivances;
    "between the years" now simply: "year, then year".
These rough mechanics, held unseen, can spoil
    the beauty of our silent spaces, take
from us the liminality, embroil
    our lives in cold and tired minutiae.
        Come sit with me, come stay with me inside
        this place between where strange new loves abide
        
"So, what does it mean?"

She shrugged and sipped her tea. They sat together in silence for a while.

"There's something about the liminal that terrifies me."

"Me too," she said...

Dim light of distant suns.

Salt-slush of silent seas.

Gravity: a tension of sorts, tidal.

Deep vents, temperature gradients, hot, cold, hot, cold hot.

Fermentation. Combustion. Digestion.

It had so many ways to keep going, to stay powered, to stay alive. All those failsafes and backups, redundancies well into the double digits. Piezos, catalytics, photovoltaics, turbines, even a very efficient stomach, all in perfect working order, all ready to snap into action.

And yet it still prefered the dim light of distant suns to remind it why.

The eighteenth whisker on the left is brown.
    I know this after countless nights awake
beside you, watching every quiet breath.
    You puff your whiskers out on every yawn.
On longer work-filled days, your whiskers wilt,
    exhaustion softening your features, sleep
exerting subtle gravities to lead
    you to oneiric seas and dreamlike sands.
I know this after countless nights awake.
    I know, I know, it's strange to watch you sleep,
but when I can't, to know that someone can...
    at least it somehow lets me rest in turn.
When I lay beside your sleeping form
    I know there's rest to still be had for me.
