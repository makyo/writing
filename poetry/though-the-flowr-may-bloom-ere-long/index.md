title: Though the flow'r may bloom ere long
---

<div class="verse">
Though the flow’r may bloom ere long
and night recede unto the dawn,
so yet may love’s embrace grow fond
and yet be spoilt upon the wan.

Brave are you and wield your smile:
A cudgel, tool, a keen-edged blade.
You are not wan, love is not spoilt;
thus I be felled and love not fade.

Have I any need for flow'rs?
For nights, for dawns, for words or breath?
With so keen and fond a blade,
There's naught to fear in life or death.
</div>
