\begin{verse}
  Though the flow'r may bloom ere long\\
  and night recede unto the dawn,\\
  so yet may loveâ€™s embrace grow fond\\
  and yet be spoilt upon the wan.

  Brave are you and wield your smile:\\
  A cudgel, tool, a keen-edged blade.\\
  You are not wan, love is not spoilt;\\
  thus I be felled and love not fade.

  Have I any need for flow'rs?\\
  For nights, for dawns, for words or breath?\\
  With so keen and fond a blade,\\
  There's naught to fear in life or death.
\end{verse}
