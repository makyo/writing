<div class="verse">
You get to explain gender to all of your friends -
    And all of your family -
    And maybe once more to be sure -
    And random strangers -
    And maybe, like, doctors and nurses who should probably know better;

You get to explain to your partner that nothing has changed -
    And that you were always this way -
    And that really, honestly, nothing has changed -
    And that this has no effect on your love for them -
    And I promise;

You will get to come out again -
    And explain that it wasn't that being gay wasn't enough -
    And explain that it has nothing to do with who you like -
    And explain that that shouldn't matter -
    And -- oh right, this means you might be straight after all;

You get to go through that awkward period of growing your hair out -
    And learning how to ask for a more feminine haircut -
    And trying a curling iron for the first time -
    And figuring out how to eat noodles without also eating your hair -
    And the worries that you're just trying to be rebellious;

You get to worry whether you're maybe just trying to be rebellious -
    And whether or not you might just be faking it -
    And whether you're really Trans Enough or not -
    And whether you're maybe just appropriating femininity -
    And whether or not passing really matters to you anyway;

You get to dress up in your best clothes -
    And your best makeup -
    And worry that your shoes are too masculine -
    And have your hair game on point -
    And convince the doc that you deserve those patches and pills;

You get to go through puberty again -
    And it will be weirder this time around -
    And your skin will grow soft -
    And you'll get more sensitive to temperature changes -
    And -- YEOWCH! That's a new sensation;

You will cry a lot -
    And bite your tongue often -
    And lower your gaze -
    And learn to take up less space -
    And talk softer;

And your dogs will still love you.
