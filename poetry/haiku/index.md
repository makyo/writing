<div class="verse">
Arctic fox's den
adorned with flowers and snow
garden in winter
</div>

<div class="verse">
A measure of grain
and a measure of water &mdash;
spring's own time and heat

Air carries the scent
of myriads of lives spent
on summer's warm breath

Crumb and density,
warmth buried beneath crisp crust &mdash;
autumn's crackling leaves.

Loves and loaves and loaves
baked for comfort in the cold &mdash;
winter calls for stores.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Leaves fall, grass withers,
and I step back to witness
winter's frozen form.

Half an hour's silence,
body relaxing slowly,
letting springtime in.

A season to stretch,
then one to learn everything &mdash;
summer's exploring.

What will autumn bring?
Maturity? Strength? Wisdom?
Dry heat and cool nights?
</div>
