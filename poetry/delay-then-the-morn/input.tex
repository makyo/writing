\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  Though every climax approach a denouement\\
  And every dawn a night,\\
  Every moment worth sharing\\
  May be worth stealing.\\
  \vin Were it with you,\\
  \vin Delay, then, the morn.

  When every touch lingers as if forever\\
  And yet seems to pass too soon,\\
  Hearts reach out to hearts,\\
  To seek, to aim, to keep.\\
  \vin Were it with you,\\
  \vin Delay, then, the morn.

  Surely it's cruelty that need begets need begets need,\\
  And yet need may bring pleasure.\\
  Pleasure may hurt, ache, burn,\\
  May steal hours of night.\\
  \vin Were it with you,\\
  \vin Delay, then, the morn.
\end{verse}
