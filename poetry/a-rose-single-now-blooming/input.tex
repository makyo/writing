\begin{verse}
  A rose, single, now blooming\\
  \vin may indeed bless the stem,\\
  yet are not roses clipp’d and shown?\\
  \vin Undoubted ‘tis a blessing to them\\
  who receive such a gift!\\
  \vin Yet now unmade is the flow’r\\
  which adorns thy mantle with its grace\\
  \vin and withers, however slowly, by the hour,\\
  \vin \vin until ‘tis faded to nothing and dust,\\
  \vin \vin though some scent remain forever amidst the must.

  A rose, single, now blooming\\
  \vin is perhaps best left on the stem,\\
  its beauty to be admired amidst the growth.\\
  \vin Surely 'tis better to long for that gem,\\
  than witness beauty wilt and dry!\\
  \vin Yet now one must long indeed, must burn,\\
  Must yearn forever for that grace.\\
  \vin To watch that growth, to explore stem's turn,\\
  \vin \vin day by day would destroy, weakening one by the hour,\\
  \vin \vin A rose, single, now blooming, forever holds all pow'r.
\end{verse}
