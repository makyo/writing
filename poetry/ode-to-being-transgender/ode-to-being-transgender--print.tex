  \noindent
  You get to explain gender to all of your friends -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And all of your family -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And maybe once more to be sure -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And random strangers -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And maybe, like, doctors and nurses who should probably know better;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You get to explain to your partner that nothing has changed -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And that you were always this way -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And that really, honestly, nothing has changed -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And that this has no effect on your love for them -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And I promise;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You will get to come out again -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And explain that it wasn't that being gay wasn't enough -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And explain that it has nothing to do with who you like -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And explain that that shouldn't matter -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And -- oh right, this means you might be straight after all;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You get to go through that awkward period of growing your hair out -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And learning how to ask for a more feminine haircut -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And trying a curling iron for the first time -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And figuring out how to eat noodles without also eating your hair -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And the worries that you're just trying to be rebellious;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You get to worry whether you're maybe just trying to be rebellious -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And whether or not you might just be faking it -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And whether you're really Trans Enough or not -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And whether you're maybe just appropriating femininity -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And whether or not passing really matters to you anyway;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You get to dress up in your best clothes -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And your best makeup -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And worry that your shoes are too masculine -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And have your hair game on point -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And convince the doc that you deserve those patches and pills;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  You get to go through puberty again -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And it will be weirder this time around -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And your skin will grow soft -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And you'll get more sensitive to temperature changes -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And -- YEOWCH! That's a new sensation;

  \newpage
  \noindent
  You will cry a lot -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And bite your tongue often -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And lower your gaze -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And learn to take up less space -\\*
  \hspace*{0.25cm} And talk softer;

  \vspace{1pc}
  \noindent
  And your dogs will still love you.
