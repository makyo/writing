You get to explain gender to all of your friends -  
&nbsp; And all of your family -  
&nbsp; And maybe once more to be sure -  
&nbsp; And random strangers -  
&nbsp; And maybe, like, doctors and nurses who should probably know better;

You get to explain to your partner that nothing has changed -  
&nbsp; And that you were always this way -  
&nbsp; And that really, honestly, nothing has changed -  
&nbsp; And that this has no effect on your love for them -  
&nbsp; And I promise;

You will get to come out again -  
&nbsp; And explain that it wasn't that being gay wasn't enough -  
&nbsp; And explain that it has nothing to do with who you like -  
&nbsp; And explain that that shouldn't matter -  
&nbsp; And -- oh right, this means you might be straight after all;

You get to go through that awkward period of growing your hair out -  
&nbsp; And learning how to ask for a more feminine haircut -  
&nbsp; And trying a curling iron for the first time -  
&nbsp; And figuring out how to eat noodles without also eating your hair -  
&nbsp; And the worries that you're just trying to be rebellious;

You get to worry whether you're maybe just trying to be rebellious -  
&nbsp; And whether or not you might just be faking it -  
&nbsp; And whether you're really Trans Enough or not -  
&nbsp; And whether you're maybe just appropriating femininity -  
&nbsp; And whether or not passing really matters to you anyway;

You get to dress up in your best clothes -  
&nbsp; And your best makeup -  
&nbsp; And worry that your shoes are too masculine -  
&nbsp; And have your hair game on point -  
&nbsp; And convince the doc that you deserve those patches and pills;

You get to go through puberty again -  
&nbsp; And it will be weirder this time around -  
&nbsp; And your skin will grow soft -  
&nbsp; And you'll get more sensitive to temperature changes -  
&nbsp; And -- YEOWCH! That's a new sensation;

You will cry a lot -  
&nbsp; And bite your tongue often -  
&nbsp; And lower your gaze -  
&nbsp; And learn to take up less space -  
&nbsp; And talk softer;

And your dogs will still love you.
