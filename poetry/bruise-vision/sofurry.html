<h2>I</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Unnerving</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>anxiety</em></p>
A hundred geese overhead —<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand —<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A million —<br>
<br>
Heady scent of premonition.<br>
Acrid tang of ill omens.<br>
Portents.<br>
Too much meaning<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In too small a space.

<hr>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Noise-Canceling Headphones</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>auditory aberrations</em></p>
Geese are a byproduct of laminar shear stress<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of two layers of phantasmagorical<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Newtonian fluids,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is why they’re often seen on a plane.<br>
A thin, sort-of Truth<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From a sort of thin layer<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; geese chromatography.

<hr>
<h2>III</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Eldrich</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>red tint to vision; hot flashes</em></p>
As the dove bears the olive branch,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; so to the goose bears the wand<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that withers all it touches.<br>
A wand of nightshade,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Core of tainted silver.<br>
A wand of obscure origin,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The goose surely stole it.<br>
Malice begets malice.

<hr>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Beyond Comprehension</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>confusion; nausea; sweating; racing pulse</em></p>
We know not the transgression,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; the origin -<br>
We know not the punishment,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; only the terror.

<hr>
<h2>V</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Excruciating</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>pounding heart; tunnel vision; racing thoughts; black-outs; blood pouring from ears</em></p>
Geas<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Horizon

<hr>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Terrifying</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>tinnitus; piloerection; shortness of breath, uneven gait</em></p>
I’d rather owls.<br>
Owls, as though geese were turned inside out,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; made less evil.<br>
Still portentous,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still momentous,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just less terrifying.<br>
Owls are okay.<br>
I can think about owls.

<hr>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Uncomfortable</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>subdermal itching; formication</em></p>
Life within a comfortable grid.<br>
Parallel lines<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Interrupting narrowing circles<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of birds in flight.<br>
Travel in straight lines.<br>
Turn at right angles.<br>
Trace the roof of your mouth<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With wet tongue.<br>
<br>
I’m not afraid of geese anymore<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because I can step on them now.<br>
I’m big enough.

<hr>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p><strong>Geese level:</strong> <em>Birds</em> — <strong>Expect:</strong> <em>birds</em></p>
Ritual thinking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Driven by geese —<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By lines, by grids, by food —<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By numbers and neat delineation.<br>
And I’m left with questions:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why are they so portentous?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why the anxiety?<br>
Or maybe:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Did I take my meds this morning?<br>
<br>
Failing that,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can I just have the comfort of prayer<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or the ecstasy of signs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without the bleak paranoia<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over circling birds?
