\begin{verse}
  The dogs assure me:\\
  There are volumes of meaning ---\\
  Life and death ---\\
  And time;\\
  Past, present, future ---\\
  In the scent of a rotting fish left after the flood,\\
  Or a trace of scat,\\
  Or the coyote, long passed,\\
  But not everyone reads poetry.\\

  \vspace{1pc}
  I'm not so lucky, all told:\\
  The rich scent of meaning ---\\
  Heady, intoxicating ---\\
  Rises only from words\\
  And the way you rest your hands on the table.
\end{verse}
