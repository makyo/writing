title: The Dogs Assure Me - 2015-03-06
---

The dogs assure me:  
There are volumes of meaning -  
Life and death -  
And time;  
Past, present, future -  
In the scent of a rotting fish left after the flood,  
Or a trace of scat,  
Or the coyote, long passed,  
But not everyone reads poetry.

I'm not so lucky, all told:  
The rich scent of meaning -  
Heady, intoxicating -  
Rises only from words  
And the way you rest your hands on the table.
