title: On Gender Bending
---

Part of the problem with bending gender in some ways is that necessitates acknowledging some contentious gender roles.  It's some sort of mixture of fun, comfortable, and acknowledging a personal problem to say, shave my legs or paint my nails, to worry about my looks (well, it's a big deal in my industry) to whatever extent and shave daily or dress nice.  On the other hand, a lot of these little steps toward stirring up those roles are, in their own way, an acceptance of the same.  

I think, all things considered, it'd be just excellent to be the type of person who could be a pretty neutral sort of thing and give the whole set of roles a miss, you know? Sometimes, however, it feels like the only way forward is to accept some of these weird, restrictive, and sometimes counterproductive gendered activities like shaving legs, things which many have to do rather than want to do.

I guess it's just one of those things that I should...I don't know, keep in mind.  I know that there's sort of this set of things that I can do to play around without doing anything too serious like screwing with hormones (more on that some other day), things that make me feel sorta...happy, in a way, I suppose.  Things that make me grin at the whole silliness of it all.  I just need to remember that I'm only subverting something already in place.
