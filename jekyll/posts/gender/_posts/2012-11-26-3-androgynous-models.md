title: Androgynous Models Who Ignore The Gender Rules

Agh, I forgot the description when posting this.

I may or may not be getting in on the whole thing 'cause of the 72 year old Chinese male model, which is just kind of awesome.  However, it's a neat article all around - not entirely filled with positive news, and there's a comment about Crystal Renn, the ex-plus-sized model, that's a little weird - but still a good read.
