title: 'Gender and Race: How Overlapping Stereotypes Affect Our Personal and Professional
    Decisions'
---

An interesting article I found through TMW.  From the link:

> "This research shows that the intersection of race and gender has important real-world consequences," Galinsky concluded. "Considering the overlap between racial and gender stereotypes — our gendered race perspective — opens up new frontiers for understanding how stereotypes impact the important decisions that drive our most significant outcomes at work and at home."

Stereotypes are, of course, quite slippery.  I hadn't really thought of the overlap of two commonly stereotyped areas of life, but these are some pretty concrete examples, and are borne out by even just thinking back to the most recent Olympics and some of the roles in sports that were played out there.  It makes me wonder how much other areas of life full of stereotypes overlap - I know that interests such as fandoms and career paths both overlap with gender quite a bit.
