> Hi Matt,
> 
> I hope you guys are doing OK.
> 
> I just wanted to let you know that we had to have Millie euthanized today.  She
> hadn't been feeling well for a couple of days and it turned out to be cancer
> that was causing internal bleeding.  It doesn't get any easier to go through
> this but it was a gentle, painless way to go.

> If there is such a thing as a "sweetness gene" she had it.  I did my best to
> spoil her and give her a good life.  Her goal in life was to be a good dog and
> she definitely succeeded.  I'll miss petting those silky ears.

> Give your dogs hugs from Grandma.

> Love,
> 
> Mom
