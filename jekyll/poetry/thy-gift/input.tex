\begin{verse}
  I reach for the ewer of water,\\
  I hope to quench the heat.\\
  I beg for yet another serving,\\
  I hope to fill my need.

  The water --- cool --- cools not\\
  Without thy merry presence.\\
  The food fills, passes, is gone ---\\
  Yet leaves me empty, yearning.

  Though the heart may quicken –--\\
  Though the tongue may lap –--\\
  I shall sup no greater meal\\
  Than thy gift entrancing.
\end{verse}
