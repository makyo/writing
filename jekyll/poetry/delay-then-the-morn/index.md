title: Delay, then, the morn
---

<div class="verse">
Though every climax approach a denouement
And every dawn a night,
Every moment worth sharing
May be worth stealing.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.

When every touch lingers as if forever
And yet seems to pass too soon,
Hearts reach out to hearts,
To seek, to aim, to keep.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.

Surely it's cruelty that need begets need begets need,
And yet need may bring pleasure.
Pleasure may hurt, ache, burn,
May steal hours of night.
    Were it with you,
    Delay, then, the morn.
</div>
