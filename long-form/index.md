Although I often write shorter posts to be read on their own, occasionally I will work on a longer-form piece of writing.  You can find these here for download or print to read at your leisure.

* [*Rum and Coke: Three Short Stories from a Furry Convention*](rum-and-coke) - These three pieces explore the lives of three individuals at the same furry convention, focusing on the topics of queer relationships, polyamory, and mental health. **Free** - *Rated: X*
