pj wolf:	Anyway, Makyo, I finished reading your rum and coke story (novella?) this morning.  
Gnarl:	are you saying your not inspired by scones with cream?  
pj wolf:	I think my exact thoughts after finishing were "That was weird. And hot. Definitely weird. And definitely hot."  
Makyo:	Oh! Yay! That's a perfectly cromulent response, I think ^^  
Makyo:	Every time I try to write fiction, a fable about gender or mental health falls out.  
Makyo couldn't even write furry fiction, it had to be metafurry 9.9  
pj wolf:    Yeah. The first story with the non-binary protagonist kinda screwed with me. I think the whole... metafurryness of it made it a bit more real to me and made me think about how okay I might be in those situations.  
Mog Moogle:	Makyo, I actually wrote a few stories with a transgendered character. It'd be awesome to get an opinion on them from you. Iffin you're up to it  
pj wolf:	All the stories, by the by. Not just the first.  
Gnarl:	Your doing better than i am , i just ended up with a chicken saving the universe  
Makyo:	Mog: Sure! I'd love to ^^  
Makyo:	pj: yeah, it's kind of an intense situation to throw people into, especially only for a few days at a con.  
Mog Moogle:	Expectations is the title. It's on my SoFurry *giggles*  
Mog Moogle:	It was rejected from Heat last year. I was thinking about expanding it and submitting to Hot Dish when it opens up again  
pj wolf:	Also, I dug how they were all at the same con. While I was certain on what the second story saw about the first, I'm less sure (though still sure) about the third story's intersection with the second.
