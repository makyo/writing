<calm> Let's think about a hypnosis session with you lying down and me sitting next to you

and just how it feels to hear your feelings and how it works to let go of what you know

as we think about a hypnosis session with you lying down and me sitting next to you.

<Slower> Let's dream about the words we use for the numbers we count to relax the mind which focuses so readily on those numbers,

counting slowly down from ten, your mind immediately reaching for

<faster> nine, which is a fine number but always looked hungry to me

and so follows eight which knows just what it ate too feel full,

and down onto seven lucky seven which is what you need to get what you need

but take away one and you get three plus there or three times two which is six

and after that five, five fingers on each hand and toes on each foot, five the sum of the Trinity and the duality,

<calm> and lets take a look at a hypnosis session as seen from above with you laying down and me sitting next to you

<faster> speaking in words like tangled coils of repetition

hidden beneath sibilant esses and susurrating syllables that tug at you this way and that

with tangled coils of repetition

beneath murmured words and suggestions and half sentences that double back on each other

in tangled coils of repetition reinforcing small hints that have you letting go and then we can move on

<suddenly slower> to four but not two fours as that'd be eight whom we already met, but you can think of it as two twos or two to the power of two, too, if that helps you

and now we're relaxing into a hypnosis session with you lying down and me sitting next to you

where we're starting to feel our breath slow and our muscles relax, feeling calm and still, feeling ourselves light upon the bed.

And now we're at three, a Trinity, the trilogy of relaxation, calmness, and lightness,

feeling each of those rise up in intensity until we get down to two,

a duality that forms the outer self that moves in the world and the inner self which is at peace,

<slowing until end> calmness and light and relaxation reaching for a plateau, and then cresting to find one,

the unity of all things, and now we're so light and calm and relaxed that we can feel whole, as a singular consciousness, and also at one with the greatness that surrounds us day by day.
