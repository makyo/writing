  \item[anthropomorphic] \hfill \\
  In its various forms, ``anthropomorphic''is used to refer to anything
  that is given human traits.  Specific to our purposes, however, this
  will usually refer to animals, either of Earth or of some fictional
  planet.  The human traits can be anything from a regular animal that
  can speak to a human with a few animal features, such as cat ears.
  However, it should be noted that in some instances, a more proper
  would be ``zoomorphic''.
  \item[zoomorphic] \hfill \\

  our purposes, this probably refers to humans.
