1. Go through the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and look at pages
2. Decide on a set of items to investigate and criteria
    * what's above the fold
    * code visible on front page
    * try code
    * mobile support
3. Build DB/spreadsheet with screenshots of pages, etc.
4. Maybe not even pass any judgement so much as present findings
