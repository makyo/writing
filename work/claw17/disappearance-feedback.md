## Catface:

Do you think it needed anything?

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:42 AM]:
Okay, so. :P

Not as a story! But maybe as porn. And that’s complicated because I don’t really know what they’re looking for.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:43 AM]:
How do you mean?

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:43 AM]:
The sex very very definitely isn’t the focus of the story.

Which is obviously fine independently.

And, actually I guess if it doesn’t get accepted to CLAW you can just…publish it anyway. :P

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
Yeah :P

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
But I’m not sure what they’re looking for, if they want something really explicit, or a lot more plot-heavy?

Not really a criticism or anything, just idle musing.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
Like, I wanted the sex to be integral, at least, in the sense that that's what triggers memories, but I get that, yeah. It's not really 'hot' :P

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:45 AM]:
Yeah, I mean, like you said originally.

It was initially just “they fuck” :P
