### Ideas

* Disappearance (aim for 7-10k)
    1. Woman tries to disappear to escape her crumbling life (ID change, life change, sudden move, attempted looks change, claws up car seats to show a struggle, busses to the coast), finds it hard to get a job with no past
    2. Winds up getting a job as a secretary, despite credentials as accountant, miserable out of under-appreciation and loneliness
    3. Visits coffeehouse regularly, always sees another young woman reading and scribbling on a pad in the corner (editor? reviewer?), something about her striking, keep catching glances
    4. Gets promotion, but only because boss is skeeving on her. Money's running out, so she has to deal with it, winds up hiding more and more at the coffeeshop
    5. After breaking down crying, other woman comforts and drives her home
        1. Comes inside to help talk about loneliness and caring, how both were lacking in the past, despite being surrounded by people and "loved ones", laughter-choked sob, "hasn't been laid in months"
        2. They fuck
            1. If we go other woman = trans route, goes down on woman but won't take off clothes
            2. Revealed in #4
        3. Discussion about how other lady tried to disappear to get away from stuff
        4. Perk! Woman comes clean, other woman says she knows, reveals that they knew each other in middle- and early high-school
        5. "So, see you again tomorrow?"
* Something about mental health driving apart a relationship and starting a new relationship
    1. Married couple, woman with OCD, husband getting more and more frustrated, wife getting more and more anxious that she's pushing husband away, making symptoms worse, trichotillomania
    2. Husband storms out at one point, wife left a mess, calls "unrequited" crush/friend who comes over, feels bad for wife, stops her from picking at herself and pacing by hugging, telling wife to pick at her own fur
    3. They fuck
    4. Panic attack next night about what happened, what will husband thing, etc, husband hollers, sleeps on the couch
    5. Husband suggests opening relationship because he can't provide what wife needs but wants to stay together, crush/friend to be integral/semi-romantic/intimate part of support network
