title: Run Ragged (CLAW)
---

1. Married couple, woman with OCD (Sélène), Aiden getting more and more frustrated, Sélène getting more and more anxious that she's pushing Aiden away, making symptoms worse, trichotillomania
2. Aiden storms out at one point, Sélène left a mess, calls "unrequited" crush/friend who comes over, feels bad for Sélène, stops her from picking at herself and pacing by hugging, telling Sélène to pick at her own fur
3. They fuck
4. Panic attack next night about what happened, what will Aiden think, etc, Aiden hollers, sleeps on the couch
5. Aiden suggests opening relationship because he can't provide what Sélène needs but wants to stay together, crush/friend to be integral/semi-romantic/intimate part of support network
6. Malina's husband (Melecio) disagrees, friend has to pull back, everything gets tense, Sélène left in weird limbo, mental health spirals, some psychosis (each tug of fur an ablution, each spike of pain sending up a magnesium flare to light that darkness), hospitalized, bipolar 1
7. Malina starts helping Sélène get what she needs, acting as sponsor
8. They start seeing each other in secret (maybe the end?)
