Sélène made a quick pass through the kitchen, fingers brushing along the rims of cabinet doors. Each one was opened and inspected, leaving her standing on tiptoes to peer in the cabinets above the counters. Nothing but cups and glasses, plates and bowls, cutting boards and pots and pans and trays and dishes. All clean and neatly stacked.

Each cabinet was carefully left ajar. The vixen had perfected the art of finding the balance point that would leave them open before the weight of the door on the hinge would close them, without simply leaving them all the way open. The barest crack.

The fridge bore her inspection patiently, door held open as she inspected along each of the shelves, gently moving well organized bottles to check between each of them. The freezer was equally patient as the vixen lifted containers of leftovers and trays of uncooked meats. Doing her best to avoid glancing at the back walls of either, she pressed the doors shut to keep the fridge from endlessly breathing cold out into the kitchen. Just to be sure, she opened them again, savoring that clean snap of the magnetic seal pulling away from the body of the fridge, then gritting her teeth in frustration as closing the door offered no such tangible reward.

The oven yawned out to her, empty. The oven was easy, because it had a light that turned on while open, and off when closed. The fridge did, too, but the oven had its pristine glass door through which she could observe the light cycling. The stove had similar lights which, the associate at the hardware store assured here, were connected directly to the burners. Even so, she touched each cooktop surface gingerly to test for warmth, turned all the burners on, then off again.

On a whim, the drawers were next. Thankfully, most of those were empty, and the rest mostly so. The underside of the silverware tray was inspected with care. While she had the drawer open, a sudden pang of fear coursed through her. Down on her knees, Sélène eased open the cabinet door and peered up toward the underside of the drawer, ensuring that there was nothing between the drawer's underside and the cabinet, and that the drawer sides didn't reach the underside of the counter, that there was a gap.

The pang continued to grow with a cool intensity, spreading out along her limbs.

So she checked the rest of the drawers.

Finally, she stood in the center of the kitchen, fished her phone out of her pocket, and thumbed the screen on. Turning a slow circle, she took a panorama of the kitchen.

She waited for the panorama to be stitched together, then pulled it up and inspected it carefully, scrolling along its length.

And there, in the doorway as seen in the pano, was the barest hint of a figure.

Her head jerked up and she let out a shriek at the sight of her husband standing at the entrance to the kitchen, tired smile on his muzzle. She let her phone drop from her hands and clutched at her chest, that cool ache replaced with hot embarrassment.

Aiden stepped forward quickly and lifted up her phone careful to touch only the edges, and deposit it back into her paw. "Sorry, Sélène, I should've stepped in more. May I hug?"

Sélène laughed breathlessly, inspecting her phone and tucking it back into her pocket. "Yes, sorry! Of course!" She leaned into her husband's open arms, breathing that familiar scent. "Are you okay?"

The taller fox --- much taller, which Sélène quite enjoyed --- tucked his muzzle over her head and nodded against her. "I'm fine, it's alright," he murmured. "You going to head into work today, sweetheart? You only have one from-home day left this week."

"I think so, yeah. Feeling pretty good today, actually." That cool ache did that thing where it didn't grow any, yet somehow made it's presence known. An easily fixable thing. "You sure you're alright?"

Aiden leaned back and nodded where she could see, then leaned in again to touch his cheek to hers --- the closest she could stand to affection around her face. "Fine, love. I'm doing okay."

Sélène returned the touch and nodded, silently promising herself that Aiden meant to say "I'm fine", rather than a resigned "fine", that her husband was just tired, not tired of her.

"I'd like to head out soon, is that alright?"

"Mmhm, I just need to grab my bag. Need to pack."

Aiden nodded. "It's by the door. Check your phone, it's already packed."

Her ears twitched to attention, smile brightening. Sure enough, just before the pano of the kitchen was a photo of the inside of her shoulder bag. Laptop, all her pens, an empty book of blank paper she never could bring herself to write in, and an umbrella.

"Alright, just a quick look. Let's head out before I get lost again," she waved vaguely at the cabinets, ignoring the cool blue sensation of doubt traveling down her arms. She could *see* the cabinets were open. She didn't need to check. She didn't need to check.

Aiden seemed to pick up on her hesitancy and set his paws on her shoulders, "Come on, bag's all packed, love."

Sure enough, it was packed.

The ride to work was about a four, she decided. She'd had better days, but this was far from her worst, even though her morning had been a seven, approaching an eight. Most of the time, she was able to look out the window at the passing traffic, and the rest of the time, she was able to distract herself with her phone. The app she used for her federated feeds gave a satisfying click every time she pulled down from the top to refresh it.

Aiden talked to her about his upcoming day throughout the drive in his calm, soothing voice. That was the second best thing she loved about him: his words seemed to instill a sense of the proper temperature. Not the cool-to-cold obsession, nor the heat of frustration or embarrassment.

He put up with her, too; that was the best thing about him.

That was one thing that always calmed her. All of the things that made her life difficult, all those obsessions and rituals, they all didn't feel like so much work when she thought about Aiden and the way he cared about her. She could as him if he was alright a million times, and he would always say yes. If he was upset about work or money, he would say that he was okay, and then explain his frustrations.

Everyone else moved so much faster than he did, so haphazardly. There was so much noise and so much movement. So many ways for things to go wrong, so many missed opportunities to make sure someone else was okay.

She'd gotten her job to let her work from home three days a week just to make sure she could get enough of a break to be productive. It had taken a doctor's note, but it had worked, and she'd kept her job.

That note was humiliating.

The medical industry solemnly swore that Sélène Kelly was off her rocker, utterly crazy, completely bonkers. All so she could get three days at home to stay productive.

The diagnosis had been fine. Her family dealt with her getting steadily worse over the years, and when they finally got her in, hearing "obsessive-compulsive disorder" confirmed that *they* were not crazy, she was. She'd resented them right up until her first dose of the emergency sublingual anxiolytic. It had made her sleepy, but it had made her mind quiet. It had quelled so many of those cold pangs of anxiety.

She remembered thinking before nodding off that night, "Fine, okay, it's just me." It had been depressing, but it knocked her resentment of her family out almost entirely.

Aiden one-upped all of her family's care: he'd fallen in love with her, he said, whether or not she checked all the cabinets to ensure nothing --- or no one --- was stuck, slowly starving to death. He'd gotten her more than just meds, he'd gotten her therapy. A doctor who was working with her on a steady program of exposure: "Next time you're in the kitchen, walk in, take a glass from the cabinet, pour yourself a glass of water, and walk out. Think about how that feels." Little steps, over and over.

And he'd gotten her more than just meds and therapy, he'd gotten her him.

By the time they'd stopped at her office, just outside the front door, the day had been knocked down from a seven, to a four, to more like a two. A brush of cheeks, two I-love-yous, and one are-you-alright, and she was off to work.

"You're picking, love."

Sélène jolted to awareness, realizing she had totally zoned out. She pinned her ears back, massaging the fur on her wrist in an attempt to cover the frayed look of where she'd been picking. "Uh, sorry, Aiden. Are you okay?"

The fox smiled and turned off the engine, pulling the parking break up with a series of sharp, satisfying clicks. He looked exhausted "I'm alright. Work was...it was a long day. Eight appointments, two meetings, no lunch. I'm starving, can we get inside and whip something up?" His expression of excitement was transparently false.

"Mmhm, I'll make us something quick," she said, giving him her best goofy grin in return. "Microwave. I promise."

Sélène felt lucky she was actually able to pull off a seamless dinner, even if it meant relying on microwaved leftovers. She loved to cook, but sometimes, reducing the friction her brain seemed intent on pushing into the act --- ovens and stoves are fraught with needs and anxieties --- was what the night called for. The more tired Aiden was, the less she wanted her personal idiosyncrasies to intrude on him, or on them.

They settled into their respective sides of the couch with their plates, and set the TV to droning. It was Sélène's night to choose, so the result was a documentary. Aiden had put his foot down early on and specified that they would alternate nights of choosing programs to watch. That had soon after been amended to specify no repetitions of a program or movie within a month's span, when Sélène watched the same documentary four times in two weeks.

Tonight was some investigative journalism piece about missing people. It wasn't particularly interesting to Sélène, but the narrator's voice was nice.

Sélène finished faster than Aiden, but she always did. All of her anxieties around correctness and proper fit and safety, and none of them ever involved food. Chow's chow.

"Sweetheart," Aiden murmured, setting his plate to the side. "Can you pet?"

The vixen straightened up and set her phone to the side, nodding eagerly. "Of course. Are you alright?"

"Mmhm, I'm alright. Is it okay if I lay down?"

Sélène nodded and shifted from her half-curled position to a proper sit as Aiden shifted and turned, settling back to lay his head in her lap.

'Petting' was another bit of exposure therapy her therapist had suggested. All that it involved petting or combing through Aiden's fur. No picking, no grooming, no inspecting. Just simple interaction with fur, with no goals in mind.

Aiden loved it. It was both exposure- and relationship-therapy, in that sense. It would let Sélène "work on her coping mechanisms", as her therapist had put it, but it was also a way for her and her husband to share touch and affection, with the express goal of not tweaking any of her obsessions *except* for those related to grooming. Those she could work on in isolation.

Sélène set to petting, brushing her claws lightly through fur, combing lazy rows into it, fingertips tracing around the base of her husband's ears. Her day had gone well enough that there wasn't any tugs this way or that on her anxiety. No tugs this way or that on Aiden's fur.

The narrator's voice droned on through the second half of the documentary, and neither fox noticed when it stopped and looped back to the loading screen. The motions of the vixen's petting had become hypnotic for them both: Aiden had nodded off, and Sélène wasn't far behind.
