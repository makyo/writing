title: Interview questions for the article In Love With Furry
---

Answer in a google doc, a pastebin, or similar.  Can also email me at makyo@drab-makyo.com - I'll also need to know whether or not I can quote you directly (any input is still good!), and if so, how you'd like to be addressed and credited!

1. Describe your current relationship status
2. Describe in brief your path to where you are now in terms of relationships
3. Did furry help with your path to your relationship configuration? If so, how?
4. Are there any ways in which furry hindered your relationships along this path? If so, how?
5. Are you comfortable talking about your relationships within the subculture? If so, why? If not, why?
6. Ditto for outside the subculture.  Are you comfortable talking about your relationships outside of furry?
7. How comfortable are you with your current relationship configuration?  Does it fit? Do you wish you could go further but feel you can't? Do you think you've gone too far?
