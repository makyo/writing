Current geese level: terrifying. Eldrich levels of geese. Honking loud enough to awaken the Old Ones.

Current geese levels: excruciating terror. Expect pounding heart, tunnel vision, racing thoughts, black outs, blood pouring from ears.

(I like geese in reasonable amounts. We just have unreasonable amounts of geese)

Geese are pretty savage. I'd imagine a reasonable amount would be two teaspoons, or less.

wall-mounted scrolling Geese-ticker.. "BE ADVISED; GEESE FORECAST LUDICROUS. REMAIN INDOORS." /sirens

Husky's gone; drowning out geese with Very Loud Chichester Psalms.

Geese levels: merely unnerving.

A goose is dumb. A thousand geese darkening the horizon is a portent. Mindless honking, individually directionless, collectively unstoppable

A goose is tasty. Geese taste like horror. Acrid tang of ill omens *froth*

Why are geese so portentous? Why do they cause anxiety? Did I take my meds this morning?

Geese levels: noise cancelling headphones. -.-

You guys took the wrong thing away from that post about geese. Geese are stupid. There is nothing wrong with geese. They taste okay.

The geese are a metaphor for get fucked.

My mental health safe-word is now 'geese'.

Keeping geese at bay through willful intent. >:T

Thin-layer geese chromatography.

Geese are a byproduct of laminar shear stress of two layers of phantasmagorical Newtonian fluids, which is why they're often seen on a plane

Current geese levels: horizon to horizon and also turn up the music.

Train horn echoing across snow woke the geese. Me, I'm clenching my toes because it's good to be prepared.

Anxiety needs a theme song! A theme song made entirely of geese.

"I'm not afraid of geese anymore because I can step on them now, I'm big enough." *swoon*

Your daily reminder that geese are terrifying hellbeasts that carry death on their wings n.n

Promises: Worse Than Geese™

Geese are horrible beasts that bring the darkness on their wings, inevitable and unstoppable, terror from above. So, no.

Geese taste like bad cereal milk!

Reviewing some recordings, and suddenly, a recording of thOUSANDS OF GEESE AND NOW I'M SHIVERING, FEELING THE CLOUD OVERWHELM ME, DEATH ON T

Just a reminder that owls are OK

Please spend some time thinking about owls today? Please, it's for all of our sake.

Please, please think about owls. Our lives depend on it...

Owls are sort of like if geese got turned inside out and made less evil? Still portentous, still momentous, less terrifying.

But, like, seriously, think about owls, because if you don't we're totally hosed.

Everyone has a moment to think about owls. Everyone.

Do your part! Contribute to the eventual heat-death of the universe! And think of owls. Please. Too much is at stake.

Clarinets are a lot like owls in that you're thinking of them both now #hoot

I have 13 minutes to remind you to think about owls. Get on it.

Did you know that the Modern Whig Party's animal is an owl? Good, now you've thought about owls.

Can I just have the comfort of prayer or the ecstasy of signs without the bleak paranoia over geese? #meme

Weird watching myself go phases of different types of withdrawal. Each bit feels different. 1/

Been sober long enough that alcohol is more an abstract thing and withdrawal effects basically gone. 2/

Fluoxetine withdrawal is still dogging me a little, but it's really mild. Brain zaps, vertigo, and insomnia, but not debilitating 3/

Olanzapine seems to come in two phases, and the ridiculous physical effects are basically done afaict, buuuuut 4/

The mental effects are starting to kick my ass. Visual disturbances, idëation, OCD anxieties, crying jags, and intense waves of paranoia 5/

I'm having the hardest time with the last bit. Sliding back into weird geese/owl territory, but now about my own words and actions 6/

I'm terrified of spilling that on others, and when I do it's The Worst™, and I have a lot lately, and I just would like to get past that. 7/

I thought I might be going somewhere with this, but I guess not. Just bear with me, I guess :P 8/8

Never attribute to malice that which can be easily explained by the horror of geese.

Remember that a goose may be tasty, but geese, darkening the horizon, bear the acrid tang of ill omens.

Each honk a single blasphemous incantation against life itself. And the honking never ceases.

As the dove bears the olive branch so to the goose bears the wand that withers all it touches. A wand of nightshade, core of tainted silver.

The wand is of obscure origin. The goose surely stole it, as malice begets malice. Also they shit everywhere.

Geese, truly some weighty geas we bear. We know not the transgression, the origin. We know not the punishment, only the terror.

Real talk. I'm mostly joking today, but it's -so easy- and -so comforting- to fall back into the ritual thinking of earlier in life.

Compulsions driving ritual thoughts. It's like scratching an itch, or a really big stretch.

Have you thought about owls today? It's vitally important that we all do our part. Keep us safe, keep us alive, think of owls.

Good morning. Last night I dreamed that new!Sulu was slaying geese for me with his folding katana. It was most satisfying ^^
