### Goals

* Each story should ask a question and explore the ramifications
* It should be hot, of course, but each story should be problematic in its own way, exploring the fraught relationship between sex and emotions
* The result of the previous point is that it shouldn't be a romance, even if it's not quite a tragedy
* Matthew is emotionally manipulative, Aaron sees it, but just doesn't hear anything from Erin to suggest she doesn't like it.

### Outline

1. **Party**

    The story of Aaron and Erin, Joan and Elise, and Matthew at a BDSM party, and their interactions.

    1. *Centerpiece* --- PoV: Erin
        1. Aaron and Erin head to a BDSM party, where Erin is to be the Centerpiece, a bound fixture at the center of the party free for use (within limits), etc.
        2. The couple are interspecies and want children, Erin, which becomes a potential problem as another mink (like Erin) shows up to the party.
        3. Erin worries at first, but Aaron turns it into a point about which to tease her as Erin gets bound.
        4. Before putting on the blindfold, Aaron pierces a condom in front of Erin, teasing that maybe Matthew, the other mink, will get it.

    2. *Hostess* --- PoV: Elise
        1. After getting Erin all set up, Aaron seeks out Elise, wants to submit because he's always being dominant.
        2. Elise agrees, and takes Aaron off to her room, gives a bit of degradation and makes him rub her paws.
        3. Aaron goes too far, Elise can't really do sex, just likes domming. They discuss boundaries and negotiation.
        4. Joan comes into the room, Elise comes up with a solution of making Aaron submit to Joan while Joan submits to her.

        2. Winds up at this party on Joan's invitation, only to be greeted by Erin, only other mink, as the Centerpiece. Intrigued as a switch, as well as as a mink.
        3. Goes through the motions with the rest of the party, making a pass at Joan and getting rebuffed because of having drank some of a pot (or pot-like) drug.
        4. Winds up settling near Erin, refereeing somewhat and trying to get closer through the night, mostly winds up teasing though, something keeping him from acting
