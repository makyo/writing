# Tracking an anthology: the steps from start to finish

Running an anthology is no small undertaking. In 2017, I began working on the *Arcana* anthology with Thurston Howl Publications. Nine months later, I had a book with a bunch of stories that I'd helped put together. That nine months, though, was a lot of work, and sometimes a lot of waiting around. Let's talk a little about that process.

The first step to building an anthology is coming up with the basic theme.

Once you have the theme, you need to decide on the dates.

When you've got your dates nailed down, you can open up for a call.

Great! The call has ended and you've now got a bunch of stories to read through.

Okay, lots of good stories, some not so good ones. How do you make the choice?

The choice is made, now it's time to send emails.

From there, it's on to editing the individual stories. (communicate with authors)

We've got our stories, they've been edited, now what? Why, it's off to the layout and design fairies!

We've got stuff in a basic layout with some design decisions made. What about the author, though? Now's a good time to show them a sample: their work in the final layout. (why)
