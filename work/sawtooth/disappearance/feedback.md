## Catface:

Do you think it needed anything?

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:42 AM]:
Okay, so. :P

Not as a story! But maybe as porn. And that’s complicated because I don’t really know what they’re looking for.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:43 AM]:
How do you mean?

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:43 AM]:
The sex very very definitely isn’t the focus of the story.

Which is obviously fine independently.

And, actually I guess if it doesn’t get accepted to CLAW you can just…publish it anyway. :P

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
Yeah :P

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
But I’m not sure what they’re looking for, if they want something really explicit, or a lot more plot-heavy?

Not really a criticism or anything, just idle musing.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:44 AM]:
Like, I wanted the sex to be integral, at least, in the sense that that's what triggers memories, but I get that, yeah. It's not really 'hot' :P

Robin Reed, [Jul 24, 2017, 10:45 AM]:
Yeah, I mean, like you said originally.

It was initially just “they fuck” :P

### re: is the main character trans or cis?

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:23 PM]:
Did you read the main character of Disappearance as trans or cis?

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:24 PM]:
Trans, but I'm pretty sure you told me that explicitly, so I'm not sure if that's a valuable answer.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:24 PM]:
Aurora was specified as trans, but the main character never was.

And now I'm realizing I don't even know.

I wrote her as cis, but there's a super strong argument for either :P

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:25 PM]:
Oh, hm.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:25 PM]:
I got a very confused beta reader.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:25 PM]:
I'm almost 100 percent positive you said something like "a trans person running from her old life" when describing it to me.

And that's the main reason I said that. I don't think there's much in the text either way, as I recall?

I'm really fascinated by like. Emergent gender. :p

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:31 PM]:
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't remember what I said to whom.

Like, I think I mentioned that, then turned the story into not being about the trans character, and gave that role to Aurora.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:31 PM]:
I can dig if I need to! But I don't know that it matters.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:31 PM]:
Yeah, it doesn't :P

I'm just really fascinated by some of the responses.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:32 PM]:
Yeah!

I'm pretty sure I was primed.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:33 PM]:
The beta I mentioned, the reader got frustrated about the MC not having a name or a set-in-stone gender, the first of which was intentional.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:33 PM]:
And I also know that "everyone is trans!" is not exactly un-Makyo.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:33 PM]:
Yeah :P

I dont know, now that I think about it, I like leaving it up to the reader :P

a bit snotty of me, but still, it seems like a fun little exercise

Uh, snooty

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:34 PM]:
Yeah, specify as little as possible.

Not really snooty! Or snotty.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:37 PM]:
It just feels a little "guy in your MFA class", I guess :P

But it's fun!

So whatever ^^

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:37 PM]:
I don't think so?

But I also play a lot of RPGs, where that's INCREDIBLY common.

I mean, the main character of Zork is named Afgncaap. Ageless faceless gender neutral culturally ambiguous adventureperson.

Just "here's the blank slate for you to fill in"

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:39 PM]:
Hah, yeah, that's fair ^^

That sort of thing is very appealing.

Wasn't a huge fan of the rest of the critique I got, because it was basically "how to make this a story I would write", but that little bit about "is she trans?" stuck with me.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:42 PM]:
Yeah, that's fair.

Especially since it's not an "error", like, you didn't just mess up a pronoun somewhere.

Madison Scott-Clary, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:43 PM]:
Mmhm

Anyway, one of the cool parts about feedback is you can decide not to act on it, and you don't need to respond either way.

Robin Reed, [Jul 30, 2017, 2:44 PM]:
Haha, I suppose!

That's always the fun part.

Deciding what's just "make this thing cater to me" versus a real improvement.

I think often about a game dev friend telling me that his least favorite bit of feedback is "this is too difficult"

Because it might be good advice and it might be awful advice and you have no idea which.

And how he basically just does what he thinks feels right until it because explicit enough.

E.g. someone telling him "this specific random combination is undodgeable" or whatever.

Good afternoon

Firstly, got to tell you I enjoyed reading this!

He are some comments from my side:

* One comment is that the erotica portion of the story (and CLAW is an erotica anthology) feels not erotic - that is, there's sex, and it's enjoyable and required for the plot, but it's nto the point of the story. Does this feel like the case? Thoughts on whether or not that direction's required for this to be a successful submission?

Claw is the F/F anthology, right?  A bit of a tough one, as it would be the first edition and the work doesn't really have an established look-and-feel yet.  Further complicating things is the fact that I don't have in-depth understanding of what fans of F/F like to read.  If the emphasis is on intimacy, rather than sex, I think this works very well.  The sex is very sweet and innocent, IMHO.  Tame compared to most M/M, M/F stories I have read.  (Most of these fall off the other end of the scale, though.)  It might be worth talking to the editor about this.  My opinion?  Give the reader a tiny bit more, but not too much.

* I want to show that the main character is different from the other inhabitants of the town in ways other than just her description. I tried to use speech patterns to do this, but wasn't sure that was effective. Does that work? Should I do more? Does it matter? :p

She stands out, yes.  But I wouldn't say she is a complete outsider, especially towards the end of the book.  The town seems to attract people like her and she seems to fit in well.  Contrast with the visitors from outside is well established, though. Also, she does feel out of place in the world she is coming from.

Other thoughts:

* I feel bad for Jarred, having his apartment trashed in such a haphazard way.  Perhaps you could indicate a more sour relationship between them to justify this a bit more?
* I feel that the MC would have chugged a few drinks after the bar closes before she has her mental breakdown.  Being an accountant, I think she's need a bit of "help" to implode like that. The stereotypical account is very inpassionate.  Alcohol can trigger all sorts of things and also help justify her extreme thirst and confusion later.
* I am curious to know a bit more about the MC and Aurora's back story.

Other than that, I think you are good to go!

Cheers for now,

Erdwolf / Jako

'Liked it' is an understatement. That may well be the most powerful (and beautiful) piece of writing I've ever seen from you. My only remotely negative thought is that it might not actually count as erotica for the purposes of CLAW, since that's a very small portion. (Even if it doesn't, I wouldn't change it to fit that criteria. It's too beautiful as is.)

I'm going to hold that feeling at the end close, and sleep well tonight because of you.

Document with track changes is attached, but wow. You've outdone yourself.

Loving you,
Zeta

### re: is the main character trans or cis?

I don't honestly know, as there could be many reasons for them leaving their previous situation. I'm assuming you left it ambiguous on purpose?

And to be honest, I thought that was one of the story's strongest attributes, as trans or cis readers could both connect with the story in their own way. The reveal that Aurora was trans at the end was beautifully affirming for me, though, and I absolutely fell in love with her right there on the spot. (Something about shared trauma and trying to help someone who's hurting connects very deeply with me.)

I just realized that I think it's that I've been Aurora for folks before, in many different situations. I'll be the one who gets them home and makes sure they're at least safe, if not (or even nowhere near) okay. Never really thought about that before, but I guess I'm glad to be that person, even if it hurts sometimes. >.<

## Skunkbomb

(inline edits in skunkbomb-feedback.docx)

Thank you for sharing this story with me! You’ve got an intro that grabbed my attention, and you put a lot of detail into your story, especially with what life is like in the small town in Oregon. The story could use an editing pass to fix the sentence fragments, and a part of me still wants the story to begin with her meeting with Adam. 17 pages is too long to wait for Aurora to enter the story. I’m glad trans characters are in the story. I don’t know of a lot of furry stories in anthologies with trans characters, but they need more visibility in fiction. I didn’t quite pick up on some of the struggles your protagonist had until I realized at the end that she’s trans (she is, right? Or did I get this wrong?), but once I knew, the story felt a lot stronger. I told myself I was only going to focus on developmental corrections, but I did a little copyediting as well here and there. Please let me know if you have any questions.

(Takeaways: do we need to know MC's reason for leaving? How do we get Aurora in earlier without outing her?)

### +

* There's a great narrative voice throughout--I  get a really good sense of the
character just from her narration, and her dialogue doesn't sound like it's
coming from another person.

* You've got very natural dialogue; capturing the awkward silences without
breaking flow.

### -

* I want *more* with regards to her past. Given how much of the start is her
wrecking everything (and faking her death, I think?) why is she doing this? Her
not thinking it through and not really knowing why is a big part of the story,
but I feel like we need insight into some inciting event. Especially given that
it's the extreme-ness of *how* she did it that leads to the climax and denoument
of the story.

Dual apologies. I know you're supposed to start with the good, and then have criticism, and then end with the good? >.> But instead I'll start with two apologies, one for taking so long to read this and two for not having anything substantive in terms of criticism. I have the file open with track-changes on and there are no changes to track.

It's really great. If I had to describe it, it's you at your best: the characters are absolutely fantastic, and the little details you use for setting them up and for putting the setting in context work perfectly. I loved this. In the overlap of literature and erotica this is definitely literature with a sliver of the erotic tantalizing it at one edge, but honestly I think that works super well for the story. You could expand it, and make it more sensory, but so much of the story in other ways is cerebral and detached that I'm not sure taking it to that level would actually serve the story's interests. It feels contemplative and it's a look that the story wears very, very well.

Some really gorgeous writing in here, put to really gorgeous effect. I'd love to be able to say something more eloquent than that, but you seem to have a pretty good handle on eloquence :)
