title: Run Ragged Notes
---

1. Married couple, woman with OCD (Sélène), Aiden getting more and more frustrated, Sélène getting more and more anxious that she's pushing her husband (Aiden) away, making symptoms worse, trichotillomania
2. Aiden storms out at one point, Sélène left a mess, calls "unrequited" crush/friend who comes over, feels bad for Sélène, stops her from picking at herself and pacing by hugging, telling Sélène to pick at her own fur
3. They get closer, hint at sleeping together.
4. Panic attack next night about what happened, what will Aiden think, etc, Aiden hollers, sleeps on the couch
5. Aiden admits to sleeping with coworker (Aaron) and his wife (Erin), suggests just opening relationship because he can't provide what Sélène needs but wants to stay together, crush/friend to be integral/semi-romantic/intimate part of support network
6. Malina's husband (Cyril) disagrees, friend has to pull back, everything gets tense, Sélène left in weird limbo, mental health spirals, some psychosis (each tug of fur an ablution, each spike of pain sending up a magnesium flare to light that darkness), hospitalized, bipolar 1
7. Malina starts helping Sélène get what she needs, acting as sponsor
8. They start seeing each other in secret (maybe the end?)

* Sélène (French/Greek) - Relating to the moon (macro: without accents)
* Aiden (Irish, from Étaín) - Sun god/goddess, diminutive of ét: passion/jealousy
* Malina (Inuit) - Strong sun goddess, not gonna put up with jealous men
* Cyril (Greek) - Lordly, masterful

Obsession | Compulsion
---|---
Afraid something got trapped in cabinets/closets/fridge/oven | Keeps checking, leaves cabinets open, etc
Afraid of hitting someone while driving | can't drive or, later, ride in a car
Fur and claws being infected | Picking, cleaning, filing, getting infections because of, reinforces
Husband and friends dying, relationship-rightness with Aiden | Checking on others, pestering Aiden about whether things are working
Other minor ones: doors latching, oven/stove being left on, lights off, being up to date with "federated feeds" (news, social) | checking
