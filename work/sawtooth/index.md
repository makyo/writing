I realized, as I was writing all of these things, I pictured them all happening in the same world, maybe even the same town. Still figuring out the specifics, but I'm collecting notes here.

### Stories

* [*Disappearance*](disappearance) --- 2017
* [*The Fool*](the-fool) --- 2017
* [*Party*](party) --- 2016--*ongoing*
* [*Run Ragged*](run-ragged) --- 2017--*ongoing*

## Spoilers ahead

### Connections

* Aiden from *Run Ragged* secretly seeing Aaron and Erin from *Party*.
* Sélène from *Run Ragged* reads news of the main characer from *Disappearance*.

Possible connections I haven't really decided on:

* Avery from *The Fool* is Alex from *What Remains of Yourself*
* Melina from *Run Ragged* is the badger from *The Fool*

### Setting

Sawtooth, ID:

* Slightly larger version of Twin falls (maybe 60k).
* Public transit akin to Fort Collins.
* University town.
* Some tech.
