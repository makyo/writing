*[11:41 PM] tlcarraway> The high that comes after a performance is surely greater than any drug. I don't have much experience with drugs, other than an abortive attempt at marijuana back in undergrad.*

*[11:42 PM] tlcarraway> They should bottle this feeling.*

_[11:42 PM] CarrieB> Good performance, then?_

*[11:42 PM] tlcarraway> Great!!!*

_[11:42 PM] CarrieB> I can tell. You always start making these grand statements after the good ones._

*[11:43 PM] tlcarraway> I do?*

*[11:43 PM] tlcarraway> I guess I do.*

_[11:44 PM] CarrieB> Last good performance you had, you started talking about Orpheus._

*[11:44 PM] tlcarraway> Oy, was I drunk?*

_[11:44 PM] CarrieB> Are you now?_

*[11:45 PM] tlcarraway> Hah, good point.*

*[11:45 PM] tlcarraway> How's my kitty?*

_[11:45 PM] CarrieB> Good, though maybe not as good as you. Been waiting for you to get back._

*[11:45 PM] tlcarraway> Waiting?*

_[11:46 PM] CarrieB> Of course! Your concerts really are great, but when they're done, that means I get you back again._

*[11:46 PM] tlcarraway> <3*

*[11:46 PM] tlcarraway> Only one more this season, kitty.*

_[11:46 PM] CarrieB> <3_

_[11:47 PM] CarrieB> Still want me to come out and watch?_

*[11:47 PM] tlcarraway> I'd love that <3*

_[11:47 PM] CarrieB> Good!_

_[11:47 PM] CarrieB> It's super late, though, but I wanted to stay up and catch you before sleep. I'm crashingg_

*[11:49 PM] tlcarraway> Yeah, go get some sleep. I need to get cleaned up, anyway.*

_[11:49 PM] CarrieB> Kk sleep well when you get there love you_

Out of habit, Linus twitched his wrist to get his watch into view, despite the clock on his laptop. It *was* late.

*[11:50 PM] tlcarraway> Love you too. Make sure you actually sleep in bed instead of the comp chair this time <3*

No reply. Good. If Carrie got to the point of barely intelligible keyboard mashing, she'd sleep basically wherever she was. Linus just had to hope she actually made it.
