Shibari cuffs, Erin had decided, were superior in just about every way to normal bondage cuffs. The rope felt better. The distnce between her paws kept her from clasping them together or being able to effectively grab on to many things. The ability to use the trailing rope for other purposes was built into the design. Just about all they could do that cuffs could not was be applied or removed quickly.

Plus, sometimes that was a benefit, as now: she watched Aaron loop the rope around her wrists held about a foot apart, then start carefully winding the trailing end of the rope around that which was strung between her paws in tight spiral from one wrist to the other to form a fairly stiff bar of rope between her wrists.

Rope was colored with all sorts of history, in a way that cuffs were not. Both in general, and for them --- one of their early dates had been at a kinbaku class.

With the remaining strands, Aaron guided her rope-bound arms up, carefully guiding the 'cuff' up and over Erin's head in order to tie it to the rope harness she wore around her torso, tying it to the harness in the middle of her back. With her elbows hiked up in the air and wrists nearly back at shoulder-level, grabbing things would certainly not be an issue.

"Okay, E?"

Erin nodded her assent, nearly purring at the slight stretch and immobility.

The morning had begun lazily enough. They had woken up and spent an hour or so besides cuddled up in bed, talking about the night before, some extended aftercare after the party. They had made a pot of coffee. Aaron had thrown together a lazy breakfast of eggs and toast. They had gotten to talking about bondage. Aaron had gotten out the rope.

Thus Erin, kneeling on the play mat on the floor and tied up in a karada, ankles bound, wrists bound and tied up over her back. Nothing elaborate, just enough to scratch an itch.

"Pretty toy," Aaron purred, prouwling around her in a loose circle. He wound up back in front of her, grabbing his coffee mug and phone off the counter where he'd left them. Snapping a few quick pictures of Erin, he grinned. "I'm sure folks will want to know that even after last night, you're apparently still up for more."
