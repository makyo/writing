### Wild Weiler

Hey Makyo,

Here are all my notes about your story. First off I do want to say that the "takes place over texts" aspect isn't that messy at all. In fact I found the text message format to be cool and inventive, plus it let me have precise markers for comments. I’m going to put that in the win column.

I really liked it. It’s so sad, and so real, and so happy. And it made me nervous, so nervous, which is good.


The part where Markus is retelling the confrontation with is in-laws literally got my heart racing. The first time through I scrolled through that section so fast I didn’t even notice the time jump in there. It might be worth considering removing that time skip at Monday, April 28. The whole story seems like something someone would stay up writing until they got it all out.


I don’t have anything to say in the way of things to change big picture.


I’m not sure if you’re looking for feedback on the app portion, but I would consider framing it so the words aren’t stretched across a widescreen monitor.


Here are some specific thoughts:

10:08 AM Markus> cryinf ovef a bvox {My phone would faithfully auto-correct this. I get what the intent is, and I like it, but that is the first thing I thought of when I read it. I’m not saying change it, just that it isn’t as realistic as it would have been a few years ago.}


{Friday, April 4 – I would recommend adding a two minute gap between … and the second “sorry”}


{Monday, April 7 and Tuesday, April 8 The whole re-telling of what Markus did with the ashes is amazing.}


2:32 PM Markus> and ?I? thought I was saying goodbye {are the question marks intentional? They show up in the app too. It looks like the question marks should be asterisks? Or hyphens like it appears later when he’s talking about how pissed the MiL is.}


10:21 AM Markus> And I do feel better, PS. I think I got more out of that than I can put into words. {This message confused me, possibly just because he has a different manner of texting than I do, but what is the PS for? Also what is the “that” in “I think I got more out of that”.}


11:11 PM Markus> I keep getting stukc crying and {This particular miss-spelling took me out of the moment because my brain wants “stukc” to be a word}


{Sunday, April 20 is perfect}


{Markus getting the file from lee should come on the left side of your app.}


{The sign off feels goofy, and that’s good. However, the messages leading up to it feel rushed. Almost like he’s grabbed his keys and is headed out the door.  I got the feeling what you may be going for is a final content look around the room before closing the door. And because of that it seems just a little too fast. If I got your intentions wrong just go ahead and ignore me}


That is it. Honestly I was hoping to have more because I feel like all I said was "This is great" and didn't have anything insightful. The truth is that it is great and if you ever chose to make it animate automatically it would be a really cool experience for the reader because you could directly control the rate at which they read it.


I loved it, I hope you doing something like this again and if you do I would love to read it.


Thank you for sharing,

I'll post here with notes so they don't get washed away:

The plot is clear, the passing of grief with elements of drama to keep it from being just a son story.

I enjoyed the format far more than I expected. I've been skeptical of this story telling since I heard about it but, one-sided texts to a late wife, good lord that was gripping.

I found the use of text and caps very natural. The typos helped display moments of shaky hands and breaking down of emotions in contrast to someone focused on writing to a dead lover and being respectful to their memory.

The end might have been a little abrupt, but that might also be because I was so sucked into the story, my suggestion would be to sprinkle some mundane activities or little messages confessing about things that reminded him Lee following the big debacle with her parents. To say goodbye and stop texting would feel too disingenuous, but to show that he's moved on and still thinks about her would be sweet.

Plot (sequence of events) is clear. Specifically, those parts which aren’t made explicit are not things that Markus would’ve said in the context of your narrative device. Markus is well written. “Gone Home” comes to mind, experiencing/learning the hidden story of an absent loved one’s life through the narrator

So there’s aspects of the story that are about Markus and his grief, and other parts that are more about Lee and her relationship with her family (through the lens of Markus)

I relate and identify with both aspects, and neither exists without the other, but they are distinct

The format works. It’s good

The caps are good. The idea of the typos is good, but some of them are distracting. I’ll have to go back through to provide specific examples. the transpositions flow fine, but some of the replacements (esp letter for punctuation) take a second to decode

The appropriateness of the ending is a hard question. I want to talk about it when I’m not at work

It is good at what it does, but I want to talk about what that does, where it leaves me

The way the story ends fits Markus’s needs. The story is his need to use that medium to cope with the loss of Lee, and it ends when he is no longer using it.

His grief (clearly) is not over at that point, but he has reached a point where texting her isn’t getting him any further through it

That it happens after the confrontation and sort-of-resolution with the MiL situation frames Markus’s (and Lee’s) relationship with MiL as a nidus for that grief

At first I thought that it made the Terrible Thing that was Done to Lee the major focus, with Markus’s grief being a frame for that, but the conversion with Dan mitigates that

The total timeline for making as much progress as he did seems quick to me, but everyone grieves differently, and as I mentioned this clearly isn’t the entirety of his grief

> *nod* one if the things that always feels weird about writing is that, although there is this huge overarching problem (Lee's death here, OCD in Theory of Attachment, etc, maybe just the human condition), you have to admit that it's too big for you, as a writer, to tackle, and you have to focus on just a small part of it. Especially in short stories. I wanted just a slice of Markus' grief.

You’re welcome. I really enjoy your writing. I’m happy to offer feedback whenever I have a chance
