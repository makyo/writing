### Wild Weiler

Hey Makyo,

Here are all my notes about your story. First off I do want to say that the "takes place over texts" aspect isn't that messy at all. In fact I found the text message format to be cool and inventive, plus it let me have precise markers for comments. I’m going to put that in the win column.

I really liked it. It’s so sad, and so real, and so happy. And it made me nervous, so nervous, which is good.


The part where Markus is retelling the confrontation with is in-laws literally got my heart racing. The first time through I scrolled through that section so fast I didn’t even notice the time jump in there. It might be worth considering removing that time skip at Monday, April 28. The whole story seems like something someone would stay up writing until they got it all out.


I don’t have anything to say in the way of things to change big picture.


I’m not sure if you’re looking for feedback on the app portion, but I would consider framing it so the words aren’t stretched across a widescreen monitor.


Here are some specific thoughts:

10:08 AM Markus> cryinf ovef a bvox {My phone would faithfully auto-correct this. I get what the intent is, and I like it, but that is the first thing I thought of when I read it. I’m not saying change it, just that it isn’t as realistic as it would have been a few years ago.}


{Friday, April 4 – I would recommend adding a two minute gap between … and the second “sorry”}


{Monday, April 7 and Tuesday, April 8 The whole re-telling of what Markus did with the ashes is amazing.}


2:32 PM Markus> and ?I? thought I was saying goodbye {are the question marks intentional? They show up in the app too. It looks like the question marks should be asterisks? Or hyphens like it appears later when he’s talking about how pissed the MiL is.}


10:21 AM Markus> And I do feel better, PS. I think I got more out of that than I can put into words. {This message confused me, possibly just because he has a different manner of texting than I do, but what is the PS for? Also what is the “that” in “I think I got more out of that”.}


11:11 PM Markus> I keep getting stukc crying and {This particular miss-spelling took me out of the moment because my brain wants “stukc” to be a word}


{Sunday, April 20 is perfect}


{Markus getting the file from lee should come on the left side of your app.}


{The sign off feels goofy, and that’s good. However, the messages leading up to it feel rushed. Almost like he’s grabbed his keys and is headed out the door.  I got the feeling what you may be going for is a final content look around the room before closing the door. And because of that it seems just a little too fast. If I got your intentions wrong just go ahead and ignore me}


That is it. Honestly I was hoping to have more because I feel like all I said was "This is great" and didn't have anything insightful. The truth is that it is great and if you ever chose to make it animate automatically it would be a really cool experience for the reader because you could directly control the rate at which they read it.


I loved it, I hope you doing something like this again and if you do I would love to read it.


Thank you for sharing,


-Wild

### Iri

I'll post here with notes so they don't get washed away:

The plot is clear, the passing of grief with elements of drama to keep it from being just a son story.

I enjoyed the format far more than I expected. I've been skeptical of this story telling since I heard about it but, one-sided texts to a late wife, good lord that was gripping.

I found the use of text and caps very natural. The typos helped display moments of shaky hands and breaking down of emotions in contrast to someone focused on writing to a dead lover and being respectful to their memory.

The end might have been a little abrupt, but that might also be because I was so sucked into the story, my suggestion would be to sprinkle some mundane activities or little messages confessing about things that reminded him Lee following the big debacle with her parents. To say goodbye and stop texting would feel too disingenuous, but to show that he's moved on and still thinks about her would be sweet.

### Dave

Plot (sequence of events) is clear. Specifically, those parts which aren’t made explicit are not things that Markus would’ve said in the context of your narrative device. Markus is well written. “Gone Home” comes to mind, experiencing/learning the hidden story of an absent loved one’s life through the narrator

So there’s aspects of the story that are about Markus and his grief, and other parts that are more about Lee and her relationship with her family (through the lens of Markus)

I relate and identify with both aspects, and neither exists without the other, but they are distinct

The format works. It’s good

The caps are good. The idea of the typos is good, but some of them are distracting. I’ll have to go back through to provide specific examples. the transpositions flow fine, but some of the replacements (esp letter for punctuation) take a second to decode

The appropriateness of the ending is a hard question. I want to talk about it when I’m not at work

It is good at what it does, but I want to talk about what that does, where it leaves me

The way the story ends fits Markus’s needs. The story is his need to use that medium to cope with the loss of Lee, and it ends when he is no longer using it.

His grief (clearly) is not over at that point, but he has reached a point where texting her isn’t getting him any further through it

That it happens after the confrontation and sort-of-resolution with the MiL situation frames Markus’s (and Lee’s) relationship with MiL as a nidus for that grief

At first I thought that it made the Terrible Thing that was Done to Lee the major focus, with Markus’s grief being a frame for that, but the conversion with Dan mitigates that

The total timeline for making as much progress as he did seems quick to me, but everyone grieves differently, and as I mentioned this clearly isn’t the entirety of his grief

> *nod* one if the things that always feels weird about writing is that, although there is this huge overarching problem (Lee's death here, OCD in Theory of Attachment, etc, maybe just the human condition), you have to admit that it's too big for you, as a writer, to tackle, and you have to focus on just a small part of it. Especially in short stories. I wanted just a slice of Markus' grief.

You’re welcome. I really enjoy your writing. I’m happy to offer feedback whenever I have a chance

### Zeta

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:38]
Nevermind, I read yours too. And I literally cannot stop crying. >.<

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:38]
Errf, I'm sorry Zeta.. :/

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:39]
I don't know what kind of feedback I'll provide yet, will have to read the script next to parse a little more, but oh my god. >.<

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:39]
[In reply to Madison Scott-Clary]
No sorries for this. Never sorries for this.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:39]
Never ever ever.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:42]
You have no idea how hard a time I have grieving for /anything/, and to be able to, even for a few minutes, is a blessing beyond what you can imagine. Healing hurts like fuck, but you're helping heal me, and I'll be damned if you apologize for that.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:45]
The 12 blank books made me smile and cry in the stupidest and best of ways. ;\_;

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:46]
Okay... I guess I'm still internalizing the "crying can be good"thing, despite vouching for it every chance I get.

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:46]
So I worried I hurt you unfairly

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:47]
No, you did not.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:48]
You let me feel my hurt.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:48]
You did not create it.

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:49]
And have you forgotten so quickly? :P https://twitter.com/drab_makyo/status/953907748785147904

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:49]
You did that, and I honor you for it.

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:52]
True, true <3

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:57]
I'm going to give it another once-over over the weekend, but about the only editorial comment I have on it right now is re: the nicknames. They feel as thought they distract slightly, maybe, though the band joke was hilarious. ❤️

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:58]
Again, might be something you're chosing to do that's not my writing style. :P I'm the romantic derp that'd have set "I miss you" as the password.

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:58]
Haha, awrf!

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:59]
And the text app viewer blew me away. I know you stayed up maybe a bit too late doing it, but the story wouldn't be the same without it.

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:59]
I made it silly nicknames because that's something Lee's parents wouldn't know

Madison Scott-Clary, [24.01.18 23:59]
But I get what you mean

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:59]
Ah, fair!

Zeta Syanthis, [24.01.18 23:59]
I was thinking something I'd be typing in after trying 50 other things, sobbing at the keyboard. :P

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:00]
[In reply to Zeta Syanthis]
Thank you! It was a fun project, and it lets me put something on itch.io

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:00]
Other than that, I don't think there's much to touch. I'll give the grammar a once over, but I know it's texting, so I'm not sure how much you care about that in different places.

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:12]
Okay, four things total:
1. The line about "cede to your mom" could use a subject in there. Feels awkward to not have "cede X to your mom" (where X is presumably 'you'?).
2. You did the cry-spelling you as "yowue" at one point, which is a little force since that's on the opposite side of the keyboard. Unlikely to be left hand hitting those keys if he's texting on a phone.
3. "1:25 PM Markus> and i’ll never stop missing you" should probably capitalize the I, since autocorrect would've done that? Up to you, though.
4. Only other thing is that I'm surprised he stayed in the same place, because that's got a lot of memories and if they spent a significant amount of time there together, that'd be hard to separate from.

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:12]
And also, thank you, again.

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:14]
Of course, Zeta <3

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:16]
I worry I primed people a little by saying "texts" when I meant something akin to telegram which can be used on a laptop, thus typos not autocorrecting/capitalizing (though I agree yowue is forced, or unlikely on non-ridiculous keyboards c.c)

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:16]
I'll give it a think, though

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:16]
And for what it's worth, I hope to be /half/ the writer you are some day.

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:16]
[In reply to Madison Scott-Clary]
Ah, okay, that makes more sense.

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:17]
[In reply to Madison Scott-Clary]
Well, you mentioned 'on the phone' too.

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:17]
I dunno, can probably ignore that one

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:18]
Could be he, like many of us, got annoyed and turned autocorrect off. XD

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:18]
No, it's good! I can make it a bit clearer in the text, even. He sent the file, but it's worth a think

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:18]
Maybe!

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:19]
Anyways, I think I'm going to go make some corn silk tea to settle down with, and then rest for the night.

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 00:20]
Okay. Rest well, please. And thank you again

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:20]
Didn't mean to stay up this late, but that story I linked kinda fed into yours beautifully, and I figured I'd give it a shot. :)

Zeta Syanthis, [25.01.18 00:20]
(Vastly different stories, similar emotional content.)

### Paul

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:51]
Mind sending me "You're Gone" so I can give it an alpha read?

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 08:52]
http://makyo.io/F

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:52]
Thanks!

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 08:52]
Or http://makyo.io/D for the script

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 08:52]
But it's well into beta and I have a release candidate.

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:52]
Oh good

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:59]
I think I've spotted a mistake?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:59]
Hard to tell because of the medium and style choice

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:59]
but:

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 08:59]
"How did so sane a cat from so crazy a family?"

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 08:59]
What about it?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:00]
+come?

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:00]
Oh

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:01]
ty

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:01]
np!

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:01]
Utterly riveted btw

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:01]
Oh, question - is the dead character's name Li, or Lee?

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:02]
Lee, Americanized.

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:02]
Or is there meant to be a difference in how she(?) has herself referred to between her family and her - OK.

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:03]
The names are more important in the non-furry version (which swaps species for race)

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:03]
The furry version doesn't do both?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:03]
I definitely get an Asian vibe from Lee's family

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:03]
I mean, I guess!

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:03]
both from the names and from the possessive family-ness

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:03]
I wrote both in parallel.

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:03]
Yeah

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:06]
"i miss yuo" (April 27, 5:50)

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:06]
this scans a little weirdly in contrast with the surrounding stuff

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:06]
oh wait never mind

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:06]
it's the end of that segment

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:08]
I'm trying to figure out how to put some space between spread out times in the client.

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:08]
Hm. Maybe an away message?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:08]
Or ooh!

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:08]
Maybe you could do the Telegram thing where you get an icon with blocks of messages (for some definition of block)

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:09]
Yeah, that's a thought!

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:09]
Lemme dig

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:10]
I'd also kinda appreciate if I saw the day breaks *before* I sent new messages

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:10]
kinda confused me a couple of times

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:11]
Also who's Junger?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:11]
Jun?

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:11]
I'd been reading that as the Japanese Jun

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:12]
Uh...danger, yikes. How'd I manage that one? :P

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:12]
"keep you safe from danger"

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:12]
OH

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:12]
Makes more sense :P

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:12]
I was like

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:13]
"Who's this Junger guy? Someone German? Should I have been reading that as "Yoon" this whole time???"

Paul Fox, [25.01.18 09:17]
OK that was really good.

Madison Scott-Clary, [25.01.18 09:18]
Thank you ^^
