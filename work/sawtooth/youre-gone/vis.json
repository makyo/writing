{"time": "", "message": "So we were really quiet and Dan was looking down at his paws a lot and your mom was glaring at me a lot and I was tired."},

{"time": "", "message": "I hate coffee, but I got a mocha or whatever, because Lee, I've just been so tired."},

{"time": "", "message": "This isn't helping, I'm sorry."},

{"time": "", "message": "i miss youl"},

{"time": "", "message": "Sorry, I'll try again and get more to the point."},

{"time": "", "message": "I tried earnestly to patch things up, but your mom just told me she remembered things differently."},

{"time": "", "message": "And it was stupid, because I could tell Dan was sad."},

{"time": "", "message": "He was sad."},

{"time": "", "message": "I don't know."},

{"time": "", "message": "I feel like he's as exhausted as I am, but for different reasons."},

{"time": "", "message": "So we took a little break because I felt like he and I were headed for a different conversation than your mom."},

{"time": "", "message": "(I didn't tell them I called you 'prissy whiskers' in return.)"},

{"time": "", "message": "It was like something snapped."},

{"time": "", "message": "That sounds cliche, but it's true. Like, she was gripping the table tight and all set to pounce, and whatever tension was in her muscles snapped violently and she threw the table."},

{"time": "", "message": "It sounds so fucking ridiculous to say it now, hah"},

{"time": "", "message": "It was scary as hell then, though. She threw the whole table to the side and then threw her coffee cup (empty) at my face and then hit Dan with her purse."},

{"time": "", "message": "And I thought she was done because everyone was shocked and staring at us."},

{"time": "", "message": "But then she started shrieking and ran to the book shelf we were sitting by and started throwing books at us."},

{"time": "", "message": "(paperbacks don't hurt that much, but hardcovers do)"},

{"time": "", "message": "He grabbed her around the middle and sort of lifted her up and turned around so that he was between us."},

{"time": "", "message": "This is dumb, but it was sorta like when I'd pick you up when you were being a fuss and carry you off to bed, laughing."},

{"time": "", "message": "So I guess that runs in the family in a creepy sort of way."},

{"time": "", "message": "Anyway."},

{"time": "", "message": "Dan got her turned around and hauled her outside, hollering at us to call the ambulance on the way out."},

{"time": "", "message": "And the badger at the bar already had the police on the phone, so she added something about an ambulance."},

{"time": "", "message": "And the police came in and started taking reports as Dan and I and the badger started picking up the books and putting them back."},

{"time": "", "message": "And all the while your mom was alternating between sobbing and throwing a hissing fit in the back of the cop car."},

{"time": "", "message": "And then I gave my report, and then Dan did"},

{"time": "", "message": "And I just kinda waved at him and left while he was giving his report."},

{"time": "", "message": "Because how awkward of a goodbye would that have been?"},

{"time": "", "message": "I met with Dr. Maura today, and we talked about the weekend a lot."},

{"time": "", "message": "She says that she thinks I did the right thing, and that this is a turning point in our relationship"},

{"time": "", "message": "our=me and your parents"},

{"time": "", "message": "And she said that it's time to work on letting you go."},

{"time": "", "message": "She said that it's not because my relationship with you has changed, or if it has, it's gotten stronger. She says that it's important that I use the energy I've had when it came to your parents and your estate and put it to work on myself."},

{"time": "", "message": "And I told her how tired I was and she smiled and said that I felt better after giving the letter to your parents because that was the first bit of letting you go."},

{"time": "", "message": "And I think she's right."},

{"time": "", "message": "I think I'd been holding you close to keep you safe from what I perceived as danger."},

{"time": "", "message": "Rightfully so!"},

{"time": "", "message": "But your mom was right in that I was keeping you from her, to some extent, and largely at your request."},

{"time": "7:59 PM", "message": "And Dan sounded like he'd perked up some, too."},

{"time": "8:00 PM", "message": "So we talked about you and sort of had the conversation that we were going to have without your mom."},

{"time": "8:00 PM", "message": "You know, memories and good stuff and rebuilding bridges."},

{"time": "8:01 PM", "message": "And he said that he'll probably be getting a divorce from your mom after the letter (I emailed it) and coming to realize just how much your mom was after him as well as you, keeping you in her service and using anxiety as a tool."},
