title: You're Gone (WORKING TITLE)
---

*[] Markus>* Doctor Maura told me I should start journaling when this whole crazy process started. She said it would keep me grounded, let me set milestones of memory, some BS like that.

*[] Markus>* I told her I'd give it a think and then promised myself I'd forget about it.

*[] Markus>* But now, you're gone.

*[] Markus>* You're gone.

*[] Markus>* Oh god.

*[] Markus>* You're gone.

-----

*[] Markus>* I made it home from the hospital a few hours ago. My hand hurts. My heart hurts. So much paperwork to let someone go.

*[] Markus>* They say I'll have to sign more tomorrow, and that I should get a lawyer.

-----

*[] Markus>* I keep expecting you to still be here.

*[] Markus>* It's not trite, like it sounds like when others say it.

*[] Markus>* Not like I'm expecting you to come around the corner or come through the door.

*[] Markus>* More like

*[] Markus>* You're still at the hospital.

*[] Markus>* You're still just at chemo.

*[] Markus>* You're out of the house.

*[] Markus>* You lost your phone.

*[] Markus>* I guess that's trite.

*[] Markus>* Though I turned off your phone.

*[] Markus>* I could hear it vibrating every time I messaged.

*[] Markus>* Couldn't tell if that made me feel sad or stupid, or both.

*[] Markus>* Both, I think.

-----

*[] Markus>* You made it to the funeral home.

*[] Markus>* In one piece.

*[] Markus>* Hah hah.

*[] Markus>* Nice skunk working with me there is irked that I keep texting.

*[] Markus>* Just showed him this.

*[] Markus>* He got quiet and smiled and said, "You can keep texting."

*[] Markus>* Feeling slightly less stupid, but no less sad.

*[] Markus>* Cremation and all that goes with it is expensive.

*[] Markus>* I mean, not super expensive. Cheaper than the other stuff.

*[] Markus>* But we didn't really plan this well.

*[] Markus>* Oh god.

*[] Markus>* I almost made a suggestion.

*[] Markus>* Oh god.

*[] Markus>* You're gone.

-----

*[] Markus>* You came home in a plastic bag in a box.

*[] Markus>* LOL

*[] Markus>* this is dumb

*[] Markus>* cryinf ovef a bvox

-----

*[] Markus>* Service Friday 4pm call Maru dad mom mil Jenna Aaron Selene flowers 664-1140

*[] Markus>* ...

*[] Markus>* Thought you should know, I guess.

*[] Markus>* Kick me from beyond the grave if I start using this as a notepad.

*[] Markus>* I know you would, too.

-----

*[] Markus>* Okay.

*[] Markus>* So.

*[] Markus>* You know I hate your mom.

*[] Markus>* I think that's supposed to be some Thing, that a husband must hate his wife's mom.

*[] Markus>* But you know that, because I'm pretty sure you hated her too.

*[] Markus>* I mean, you never said so to my face or anything, but you did all you could not to be in the same room as her.

*[] Markus>* (I know you hate your stepdad)

*[] Markus>* \*hated

*[] Markus>* fuck

*[] Markus>* sorry

*[] Markus>* ...

*[] Markus>* sorry

-----

*[] Markus>* Anyway, that bitch was there at your service.

*[] Markus>* Of course she was, I mean.

*[] Markus>* But I call her a bitch because she was.

*[] Markus>* She made it sound like I killed you.

*[] Markus>* She said if her daughter had married another cat, it would've been fine.

*[] Markus>* But no.

*[] Markus>* You married me.

*[] Markus>* And I don't know how, but somehow it became my fault that you died.

*[] Markus>* We went from crying together over supermarket snack trays to terse arguments in surprisingly little time.

*[] Markus>* She thought that if she'd married a cat, she would've had kids and a happier life.

*[] Markus>* I don't know where the cancer came in, but she was convinced that this was somehow the cause of it.

*[] Markus>* Marry a coyote? Get cancer.

*[] Markus>* I mean, duh.

*[] Markus>* She really wanted grandkits.

*[] Markus>* (didn't tell her about the ligation. You never did, so I promised I wouldn't)

*[] Markus>* Anyway.

*[] Markus>* I'm really upset.

*[] Markus>* The service wasn't meaningful. It was boring.

*[] Markus>* Your mother aside, I think that's the most upsetting thing.

*[] Markus>* Your service was boring.

*[] Markus>* I got home at nine or whatever, and I just sat on the bed.

*[] Markus>* I fell asleep in my nice clothes.

*[] Markus>* Now I'm sitting on the bathroom floor waiting for the water to heat up, and it's already hot, but I'm still on my phone, just like you hate.

*[] Markus>* \*hated

-----

*[] Markus>* Thank you for leaving a will.

*[] Markus>* Met with MiL again, this time with lawyers.

*[] Markus>* Thank you for leaving me everything.

*[] Markus>* Even your ashes. Your mom hated that most, I think.

*[] Markus>* You left me will all of our debts, but you left her with nothing.

*[] Markus>* Surprised I don't feel self-righteous or whatever. Just resolute. I didn't "win". If anyone won, it was you.

*[] Markus>* But if I'd had to cede to your mom and stepdad that would have hurt.

*[] Markus>* Thank you.

-----

*[] Markus>* I formed your ashes into a rock by mixing them with water and baking until they got hard, and then I skipped it across the university pond.

*[] Markus>* Kidding.

*[] Markus>* I know you asked for that.

*[] Markus>* I also didn't dump your ashes out in the parking lot of your office.

*[] Markus>* I didn't dump them in the plaza fountain or flush them down a toilet at your office, either.

*[] Markus>* Sorry. All your last wishes gone to waste.

*[] Markus>* I took your ashes and drove up into the hills, because I decided this wasn't for you.

*[] Markus>* I'm sorry.

*[] Markus>* I drove up into the hills until I got to one of those pull-aside rest stops, and I walked down to the river there, and I just sat for a bit and cried.

*[] Markus>* And I wasn't thinking.

*[] Markus>* And I cut open the bag of ashes and scooped a few pawfuls of water in there and mixed it up to a sort of smoothie consistency.

*[] Markus>* And I poured it out on the river bank.

*[] Markus>* And I kinda mixed and kneaded and massaged it into the river mud.

*[] Markus>* And I just kinda cried and gave you up bit by bit.

*[] Markus>* The water would splash up on the banks and I just let you be carried away bit by bit.

*[] Markus>* Until there was nothing left but a messy spot on the shore.

*[] Markus>* And I washed my paws.

*[] Markus>* And it was super cold.

*[] Markus>* And I only had my jeans to dry my paws on, so I just sat there like an idiot.

*[] Markus>* Crying and puffing into my paws to try and warm them up.

*[] Markus>* You'll be proud to know that it was disgusting.

*[] Markus>* there's you all over that river bank

*[] Markus>* and all over my paws

*[] Markus>* and stuck in my fur

*[] Markus>* and probably on my muzzle

*[] Markus>* and the steering wheel of the car

*[] Markus>* and the doorknib

*[] Markus>* asnd your all over now

*[] Markus>* and ?I? thought I was saying goodbye

*[] Markus>* and your still here

*[] Markus>* i miss you

*[] Markus>* i love you

-----

*[] Markus>* Okay.

*[] Markus>* So.

*[] Markus>* Not only was that a mess, but it was apparently illegal.

*[] Markus>* I slept and feel better, and now I'm giggling like an idiot over the fact that I did something meaningful to me, and it turned out I was breaking the law the whole time. You're not supposed to scatter ashes in water.

*[] Markus>* (And even if it were legal, there's probably a better way to do it than what I did.)

*[] Markus>* So there you have it. I thought I was going to snub your goofy wishes but your idiot husband wound up going along with them all the same.

-----

*[] Markus>* And I do feel better, PS. I think I got more out of that than I can put into words.
