title: You're gone notes
---

NB: I'm working on the timestamps for all of the messages, as is evident by so many of them missing. If you see a `...` on its own line, that's a note to myself to jump ahead in time.

Questions I'm intereted in:

* Is the plot clear?
* Does the format work?
* Does the playing with text (all caps, typos when crying, etc) work?
* Does it end too abruptly?
