## Maddy --- 12/9

* The ending as is is pretty sudden and falls flat
* The ending was intended to be a shift from Aiden being a passive support of the whole thing where he lets Sélène do her work to being an active participant of "oh shit, I have to take part, too", but I think I kind of failed at that. Sélène is the protagonist, but is largely static. Aiden and Malina are deuteragonists, and anxiety is the antagonist. Aiden is the only dynamic character. The story is kind of him being pushed past his identity as Sélène's caretaker so that he can be more complete, himself.
* At the same time, I don't want to dehumanize Sélène and make her a vehicle for a message. Sure, the madness rides her some days, but she's a participant too.
* I worry that Malina is introduced too late
* I worry about the characters sounding the same.
* Ending is a bit all over the place. Arguments always are, but this should be tighter, like "shit, I've defined my life by caring for my wife and basically both of us want me to have a life too"

## Zeta --- 12/9

* I'm like two scenes in and I'm already loving it. I think (hope?) that Dakota would recognize a bit of Aiden's caretaker nature in me.
* Also, I do the "Are you okay?" thing myself, and I think I finally realized what it was the other day. I think I feel the pain others do reflected in myself, and am extra compelled to help others when I'm a mess and can't help myself.
* I'll also say that you capture really well the feeling of safety with another person without that person having to be your entire world? Like it's weird, because they are and aren't simultaneously, because others can and can't be too. Anyways, that's something I'm working on. I'm basically unable to ever truly feel safe, with anyone or anything. I have rare moments, but they're stupidly fleeting. >.< Disappearance helped me find one of those moments, hence my love for it and you.
* And A Theory of Attachment is beautiful. It's a bit less viceral for me than Disappearance was, and I'm still working on so many of the things that are in that that I'm not sure what to think, but it's beautiful.
* Actually, I just had one thought, depending on what you wanted to be shooting for. The reveal at the end re: the cabinets put things in perspective a bit, but was a bit of a surprise. I thought that was entirely OCD related, but to know it had happened to her and that she was terrified of it ever happening again... might make more of an impact if you started the story with a flashback to that rather than tacking it on at the end? I think it's actually really good, but from an emotional point of view, it'd be a lot easier to connect with her actions re: the cabinets if we knew of that terror ahead of time. (If nothing else, foreshadow with terror of being locked in darkness)
