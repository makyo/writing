title: A Theory of Attachment Notes
---

<!-- NEVERMIND LET'S BE HAPPIER
1. Married couple, woman with OCD (Sélène), Aiden getting more and more frustrated, Sélène getting more and more anxious that she's pushing her husband (Aiden) away, making symptoms worse, trichotillomania
2. Aiden storms out at one point, Sélène left a mess, calls friend (Malina) who comes over, feels bad for Sélène, stops her from picking at herself and pacing by hugging, telling Sélène to pick at her own fur
3. ~~They get closer, hint at sleeping together.~~
4. Panic attack next night about what happened, what will Aiden think, etc, Aiden hollers, sleeps on the couch
5. Aiden admits to sleeping with coworker (Aaron) and his wife (Erin), suggests just opening relationship because he can't provide what Sélène needs but wants to stay together, friend to be integral/semi-romantic part of support network
6. Malina's husband (Cyril) disagrees, friend has to pull back, everything gets tense, Sélène left in weird limbo, mental health spirals, some psychosis (each tug of fur an ablution, each spike of pain sending up a magnesium flare to light that darkness), hospitalized, bipolar 1, Aiden disappears
7. Malina starts helping Sélène get what she needs, acting as sponsor - cyril unhappy, Aiden returns from bender
8. ... (on the way back up)
9. ... (end reasonably positive, if damaged) -->

1. Married couple, Selene and Aiden, with Selene's crush and potential new third partner, Malina, date in a few days
2. Talking through the date, addressing Aiden's fears (over and over again)
3. Date goes really well for Selene, Aiden happy for her, but stressed working through the ramifications
4. Selene and Malina play around next date
5. Aiden gets upset and angry because their attempts at sex were always stressful, whereas this came easy to Selene and Malina, agrees to give it one more go, but asks if he can start looking around, too, admits he's been talking with Aaron and Erin
6. Third date at Malina's, Selene has been on edge since and has panic attack similar to PNES, locks herself in the bathroom to be away from cabinets, texts Aiden, who calls Malina and races over and stays on the phone meanwhile, talking Malina through helping Selene
7. They all wind up eating together, despite it being a date, Selene mentions cabinets as PTSD/OCD interaction, having been locked in one as a kid, how family never understood her but Aiden did, and Malina was okay with learning to
8. End on hopeful note of each of Selene's partners playing a role in her life: Aiden is practical-supportive and steadfast, Malina is emotional-supportive and fluid

Notes:
* cheekrub kiss
* Emphasize helplessness before anxiety, madness riding her
* ...

Names:
* Sélène (French/Greek) - Relating to the moon (macro: without accents) - fox

Obsession | Compulsion | Cause
---|---
Afraid something got trapped in cabinets/closets/fridge/oven | Keeps checking, leaves cabinets open, etc | Locked in a cabinet as a kid by mom as drunken punishment
Afraid of hitting someone while driving | can't drive or, later, ride in a car | Making sure others are alright (viz social anxiety below)
Fur and claws being infected | Picking, cleaning, filing, getting infections because of, reinforces | Never being groomed enough for mom
Husband and friends dying, relationship-rightness with Aiden and Malina | Checking on others, pestering Aiden about whether things are working | Having to make sure mom was okay, would be seen as ignoring/ungrateful if not
Other minor ones: doors latching, oven/stove being left on, lights off, being up to date with "federated feeds" (news, social) | checking | High anxiety
