## I

[Listen](malina-1.mp3)

<div class="verse">
It was with no small amount of irony
that Malina lay down all of her finery

and went to work in a coffee shop.
The Book and the Bean was a short hop,

after all, from her home, close enough
that, after the walk, she was hardly fluffed

at all. Just a badger, a bit portly, a bit tall,
who gave up on a job in personal finance, one fall,

to, as she'd told Cyril, "head for greener pastures."
Internally, she couldn't shake the stress of last year's

troubles with the boss. Stupid git.
She'd promised Cyril that she'd be a good fit

and make things work out financially.
"Our house is paid off, we're substantially

self sufficient. Far more so than most!"
she'd said over that evening's roast.

"And I'm perfectly willing
to admit I'll never make a killing

working in a coffee shop. And if it doesn't
work out, I'm just as willing to admit it wasn't

a good idea, and head back to the books."
Cyril had given her the weariest of looks

and shaken his head, and that act, or non-act,
which showed his opinion of the fact

that moving from a comfortable CPA position
to a barista down the road, that that transition

was, perhaps, one big bad idea.
"It could work, but Malina,

please keep an eye on reality."
