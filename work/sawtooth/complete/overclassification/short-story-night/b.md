st Dani's alarm went off too early on Monday. It was the same six AM as every other weekday, but getting up proved harder.

st She silenced the alarm and sat up in bed, groggy. She had a kink in her tail. Not an auspicious start to the week. The cold, the soreness, the weekend.

st It took a few minutes for her brain to unfog enough to remember that Alex --- or was it Anne? --- had claimed her beanbag the night before.

st Well, okay. The cold, the soreness, the weekend, *and* the homeless girl camped out in her living room.

st Dani groaned. She'd not thought this through well enough yesterday. She had work, she couldn't do that *and* help out a homeless girl. She'd either have to call out from work or find a place where Alex to stay. Maybe both.

st The otter levered herself up out of bed, stretching longly and trying to work the kink out of her tail. Tweaked it over the weekend, perhaps, or just slept on it funny. Made it hard to walk without wobbling.

st She tugged her phone from its charger on her desk and swiped a pad across it to unlock the screen.

st Two new voice messages. One from late last night, one from an hour ago.

st "Hi Dani, this is Erin. I got a call from facilities saying that they were having problems with the steam plant. You're usually first in, can you check on things first thing and call out to others if there are any problems in the building? Thanks a million."

st Dani furrowed her brow and skipped to the second message.

st "--all employees and students. There will be an inclement weather closure on Monday the 30th of January. This closure affects all employees and students. There will be an inclement weather closure on--"

st Her furrowed brow turned into an outright frown. Still standing in the middle of her cold room, she pulled up the university website on her phone. Right at the top of the page in bold, red text, an announcement.

st > **Inclement weather closure**  
st > Monday, January 30, 2017
st >
st > On Sunday evening, a boiler in central heating ceased working. The back-up boiler was brought online, but cannot heat all campus buildings to a safe temperature. Crews are working to replace the boiler.  
st > Temperatures have reached -30, stay inside and keep warm."

st "I guess that solves that," Dani mumbled.

st Remembering her guest, she slipped on a loose pair of pants before heading out to the kitchen and living room. Alex was a lump of clothes and blankets on the beanbag, the only visible part of her being the tip of her tail peeking out from beneath two layers of blankets.

st It *was* cold, Dani thought, and checked on her thermostat. She bumped it up a few degrees, wary of the outcome if it got too low. Hot water baseboard heaters were nice and all, but the last thing she wanted was for one of them to freeze and for the pipe to burst.

st She set about making the quietest cup of tea she could manage, waddling around the kitchen as best she could with the ache in her tail. She was normally a coffee drinker, but that'd wake the ringtail in the living room. Tea would do fine, though, if she didn't have to race into work.

st Alex grumbled from beneath the covers at the sound of the water boiling in the electric kettle, but, as far as Dani could tell, kept on sleeping.

st The otter spent the next few hours holed up in her bedroom, sipping her way through a mug of tea. She poked through news and stories on her phone, before pulling down the book of folklore classifications.

st Her life was in disarray, she knew. Alex had thrown a wrench into things, into her neat little life and her neat little apartment. It brushed up against all sorts of weird desires to keep both life and home organized.

st Not that the bassarisk had been a problem. She'd set her backpack down where backpacks go, she'd given Dani her plate when she was done, had used the bathroom once or twice. She had, in fact, not budged from her spot on the beanbag otherwise.

st And yet this all felt like some intrusion.

st Perhaps it was the way in which Dani approached it. Perhaps it wasn't Alex at all, and it was all just on her. She was the one who had taken Alex in. She was the one who was stuck thinking about this. For Alex it was nothing, she could keep clean and to herself. It was Dani who was having a hard time classifying things.

st She realized she was doing the same with her book as she did with her movies. Her eyes scanned over the words in the thin workbook, but none of the text made it further into her mind. She covered each line, recognizing letters, before turning the page.

st *I should just put it up,* she thought, feeling grumpy. *I'm not getting anything out of it. I could take a nap.*

st She shook her head to shake wandering thoughts into a sense of order, and turned back to the index of folklore motifs.

st Maybe she could come up with a story to tell Alex.

st -----

st The silence --- or at least quiet snores --- from the living room slowly morphed into soft rustlings, and then from there to audible yawns and the sound of padding feet heading to the bathroom.

st Dani levered herself quietly out of bed and snuck into the kitchen before Alex could make it back out of the bathroom.

st "Coffee?" Dani asked when Alex stumbled back to the beanbag. The ringtail sat down heavily on the cushion, looking mussed up from her night's sleep.

st "Nngh. Mmhm."

st The otter nodded and flicked a switch on the little countertop espresso machine, then set the grinder to run for two shots worth of coffee grounds. The tea had helped, of course, but she suspected the coffee would help all the more.

st "You're chipper," Alex grumbled.

st Dani nodded. "Been up a few hours already. Dad always used to get us up early for the sunrise. He said it wouldn't rise without us kids. Someone had to be there to see it."

st The otter finished pulling one shot of espresso, and walked it over to the ringtail on the couch. "Let me know if you need milk or anything."

st Alex shook her head, sipped gratefully at the bitter coffee.

st "Anyway, one day we all got sick. One of those bouts of the flu that catches the whole house at once." Dani tamped down the grounds in the portafilter, using the tamp to brush the grounds off the rim. She paused to lick a finger and sweep up a scattering of grounds that had missed the used-grounds container she built the shot over and wound up on the counter, flicking the gritty coffee back into the container.

st "We all slept in to--" She leaned back to look at the clock on the microwave. "Until about ten thirty. We were all so surprised when we saw the sun had risen without us."

st Alex laughed as Dani pulled her own shot. "Oh yeah? And which number is that?"

st Dani leaned back against the counter and laughed, wincing at the strain in her tail and clutching her little demitasse in her paws. "You got me. One hundred fourteen."

st The ringtail held onto her empty cup with one hand and leaned back onto the other, grinning up to the otter. "I'll give your delivery an eight out of ten, but the story needs work. Did you rehearse it?"

st "A little," Dani admitted, ears and whiskers both canted back in embarrassment. "Was it that obvious?"

st "To me, yeah. But I live off stories. You get a feel for truth, lies, and the right mix, you tell enough stories. You can hear when one's being told on the spot."

st "What about mine didn't work?"

st The ringtail shrugged and leaned forward to pass over her cup when the otter held out her paw.  "Your truth-to-lie ratio was good. Lemme guess," she said, tilting her head. "You got up with your dad, but don't have any siblings."

st Dani laughed. "Yeah, that's it. How'd you guess?"

st "The way you talked about your mom last night, about stealing office supplies." Alex shook her head. "It wasn't that, though. Like I said, that was good. The, uh...what's it. How much the story means..."

st "Consequence?"

st "Yeah, it was inconsequential to a good level. You tell a story, and if you're trying to weave one, you don't make it too consequential. You told me a true story last night; those can be consequential. A tale should make you care enough to laugh or cry, but not much more."

st Dani thought for a moment. "When we'd talk about folktales, we'd talk about what tied them to one culture versus another, even if they'd share a common core. That feels pretty consequential."

st "I guess a little." The ringtail shrugged and stood up once more. "But you're not imparting deep wisdom. They're all just stories, still. They gotta be light, inconsequential --- and yours was --- but they also gotta be, um...spontaneous."

st "Extemporaneous, maybe?"

st "That's it. They gotta be on the spot. Yours was just too rehearsed."

st Dani grinned and shrugged, "I'm not sure if I could do that."

st "It's not for everyone. You--" She paused for a moment, thinking before continuing. "You're too organized. Too OCD to pull a story out of thin air like that. Hey, can I grab a shower? I know you're probably sick of me, but I really need one."

st The OCD comment had caught Dani off her guard. She had so many thoughts, countless words, about how she was or wasn't that. She didn't have the *F42* required for *F42*-dom. All of those had disappeared, as they always did at time of need.

st She just nodded and waved Alex into the bathroom.

st -----

st "So, it's gotten down to negative thirty. I know I was going to offer to help you get more layers, but I think it's too cold for even that."

st Alex nodded and kept quiet. She looked as though she were preparing to be kicked out.

st Dani hastened to clarify, "I don't even want to go out to the car. Plus, my tail hurts too bad to do much more than sit around. You alright just staying in until things warm up this afternoon? I can get you to Open Door or another place if you don't want to."

st The relief was writ plain on the ringtail's face. She nodded. "Yeah, that'd be good. I don't want to go out either. Really don't want to go back to Open Door. Can I, uh...can I help out any? I don't have much to pay with, but I can do work or whatever."

st "There's not really much to be done, I don't think." Her expression softened. "You're just welcome to say until things warm up, Alex."

st "Amy."

st Dani blinked.

st "You can call me Amy today." The ringtail grinned.

st "First Anne, then Alex, now Amy?" Dani laughed.

st "A real name holds power, right?"

st The otter thought for a moment, then nodded. "Five hundred, yeah."

st Alex--er, Amy rolled her eyes. "They really did include everything in that catalog, didn't they?"

st Dani nodded as she waddled over to the couch. "Yep. Five hundred is a trickster who will be defeated by someone knowing his true name. Crap," she interrupted herself. "How the hell did I mess up my tail? I don't think I did anything to it yesterday."

st "Well, it *is* big."

st Dani laughed, changing trajectory to the beanbag and laying down on her front. "Yeah, it is. Still, I didn't think I could sprain a tail."

st "Well, doesn't that just make us a pair? I don't have the clothing to go outside, and you can hardly walk."

st "Guess it was good fortune, then."

st "Does your catalog of tales have anything to say about this? Is three hundred and eighty a story about an injured person being stuck with someone who can't go out in the cold?"

st The otter shrugged. "I don't think so, no. And there isn't a three eighty. They're all organized into a hierarchy, and they leave some numbers unassigned so that they can add to them later on."

st Amy grinned. "How do you even know all this?"

st "I went to school for it."

st "And they made you memorize it or something?"

st Dani rested her chin on her folded arms, a motion to conceal some embarrassment. "They didn't make me. I did because it was fun."

st The ringtail stared in disbelief, then motioned for her to continue.

st "I really like organizing things, and--"

st "I could tell."

st Dani smirked, then continued. "--and I like the way things can be categorized while still retaining everything that makes them unique. Like, the five hundred from earlier? That's a vague classification that can be applied to many stories, which are all different from each other."

st "Sorta like putting things in a box, then?"

st "I guess. Or writing them down on a sheet of paper with a specific heading, then putting that sheet in a folder, which is put in another folder. At the very top, you give rules for how to get to what you need."

st Amy looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded. "Makes sense, then."

st "What does?"

st "Your inability to be, uh...extemporaneous. You can't pull things out of thin air, 'cause you're rifling through a catalog."

st Dani stayed silent.

st "I mean that in the best of ways!"

st Dani shifted over onto her side enough to look at Amy more directly, trying to look as kind as possible. She had no idea how to take this being told that she was uninventive.

st "Well, listen," Amy continued. "You have OCD, right?"

st "I don't know. I've been told I don't."

st "But, like...look at you. Everything about you is based around order, around the need for things to be in their place, all classified."

st "Well, sure," Dani demurred. "But OCD requires anxiety that I don't have. You have to feel anxiety about things that you obsess over, and you have to have the compulsion to fix them at all costs. I don't have those. I just classify things. That's just what I do."

st Amy looked thoroughly sorry for having brought the topic up. All the same, she persevered. "Okay, well, maybe not OCD, but my ma, she told me that there's all these disorders around anxiety, and each has a personality disorder to go with it." Her voice was fast, as though she were rushing to fill a hole she was digging herself into. "Maybe you have that? Obsessive-Compulsive, uh...personality disorder?"

st Dani reached out a paw to rest on Amy's. None of this was too terribly surprising, it was all stuff that made sense. Still, Amy had talked herself into a tizzy. The ringtail looked absolutely panicked. "Maybe," Dani allowed. "What does this version entail?"

st Amy took the hint from Dani's paw on her own. She smiled bashfully and made a show of calming down. "They, well," she straightened up, organizing her thoughts. "They are like the regular dis--er, they're like the regular ones, but without the anxiety. The life is ordered, order is the obsession, but without, uh...without the pain."

st The otter thought it over, spending a few seconds grooming her whiskers back. "I guess that makes sense. It's something that isn't eating me alive, but it's still a big part of me."

st Amy nodded, turning her paw up to let Dani's paw slip into her own, resting the her free paw on top of it. "I really do mean that in the best way."

st Dani laughed and rolled the rest of the way onto her side, letting her aching tail rest against the side of the beanbag, taking some of the weight off. "No, I get that. It really does make sense. I saw someone about it years ago, on an old girlfriend's suggestion."

st Amy tilted her head, though whether at the 'girlfriend' part or the 'seeing someone about chronic neatness' part, she couldn't tell.

st "My doctor said it wasn't OCD, just part of my personality. Not something I felt bad about, something I felt good about. My ex still thought I was crazy, though."

st Amy patted at the otter's paw in her own, then gave it a little pet, brushing fur that was already straight all the straighter. "Can I confess?"

st Dani laughed. "Of course. I'm no priest, though."

st "I didn't think so" Amy laughed. "Anyway, I guess I saw how neat you were, and that's why I've told you so many names. Just add a little disorder to your life."

st "None of them real?"

st "Of course not." The ringtail grinned as mischievously as she could. "I can't tell you that, remember?"

st Dani laughed. "Right. Five hundred."

st "How many of those classifications are there, anyway?"

st The otter started counting mentally, then perked up. "In the bedroom, there's a book on the bed. I was reading it after yesterday. That should have the catalog in it. Go grab that."

st "Uh, me?"

st "Yeah, you." Dani laughed, "My tail hurts too much. I'm laying down and you're sitting. I'm older than you, probably. Just because."

st -----

st "Okay. Fourteen seventy five."

st Dani had found a few comfortable spots on the beanbag, alternating between stretching out on her front and laying out on her back with her tail resting between the folds of the cushion. "Right, hmm. Back when I was a kid, my dad used to take all of us to church. The preacher was a kind old guy, but one day, he got it into his head that it was best to keep it in the town.

st "He saw us girls sitting in the front row and asked us all to come up on the stage. It was so embarrassing. He made us promise to God and the congregation that we weren't to be married to girls in other parishes.

st "Everyone laughed and laughed. *Girls marrying,* they'd say. *Good joke, preacher.* But there I was, standing up there with my sisters, saying I'd never marry a girl from another town. All my hopes and--I'm no good at this, am I?"

st Amy laughed and slapped her paws down on the page. "No, you're good! You came up with that better than I thought you would'a. You just got all stiff at the end, is all."

st Dani grinned. "Makes sense, I guess. I kind of get the rhythm, but it's hard for me to just pull it out of nothing. I get part way through and start thinking about my story too much, about what other categories it fills. I start thinking, *oh, that's four eighty, the kind and unkind girls* and then I'm totally lost."

st "Yeah. I can tell. You get this look on your face when you get to let go. You get all confident lookin' and then you fall apart, and I can almost see the filing cabinets in your eyes."

st They laughed together.

st Contrary to expectations, the outside thermometer had pegged itself at thirty below for a few hours and then, around noon, started to drop even lower. They had eaten a late lunch. Amy asked if she could wash her clothes while she was here, and Dani had found her a shirt and pair of pants that would fit meanwhile. The temperature stayed cold through the afternoon.

st Neither were keen to go outside and see just how cold, so they'd parked themselves on the beanbag with the catalog of folktale types.

st Amy had said that she was going to teach Dani how to tell a story, but that was a thin excuse for a continuation of the sleepover atmosphere. What would be more 'sleepover' than telling stories and a friendly competition?

st Dani was losing, that much was obvious.

st "Alright, ninety one," she said. "When someone is caught for their heart (or paw, or eyes) as a remedy --- like one's heart or fingers being the only cure to an illness --- but convinces the antagonist that they left it at home."

st Amy grinned and launched right into the story. She would always win, so long as she could jump right in like that. "Oh yeah, that reminds me of one of my daddy's stories. He laughed about this all the time, said one day, this cat came to him. One of those all black ones, the uh..."

st "A panther?"

st "Yeah, that's the one! Daddy would always say hi to this guy as he walked his property. He used to walk the perimeter of his property and make sure all was okay, but it got him to talking with all his neighbors.

st "Anyway, one day, one of his neighbors takes a shine to his tail, says, *Dang, you know, I wish I had that tail. My wife left me some years ago, you see, and I bet the gals would be all over me, I had a tail like that.*  Dad would laugh, we'd all laugh at that. Poor old Mister Lincoln, he looked like a shadow in every picture, like someone had cut out someone, wherever he went.

st "Now dad, he can sense Mister Lincoln starting to get more insistent about things, and one day, on a hunch, he grabs a handful of soot from the fireplace --- we hardly ran the thing those days, but the soot was still there --- and rubbed it into his tail."

st Dani laughed, picturing Amy rubbing soot into her tail, turning the stripes all black.

st Amy grinned. "So dad, he's got this all-black tail. It was nearing night, so it wasn't too out of place, but sure enough, once he runs into Mister Lincoln, out walking his property, the big old guy grabs dad by his collar, starts shaking him, asking for his stripes!

st "Dad doesn't know what to do, starts squealing, just as sure as I would.

st "Well, didn't take a genius to know Mister Lincoln was as drunk as he was plain. He thought he could grab the stripes off daddy's tail and take them for his own. Maybe he'd put them on his face and gain some features. Maybe he'd put them on his paws, so he could always see where his hands were. Maybe he just plain wanted dad's tail."

st "And he left it at home?" Dani asked, giggling.

st "Of course he did! Dad, he told Mister Lincoln he left it in the trunk by his bed. *No stripes today, sir,* he said, kind as could be. *Talk to me tomorrow, though, and I'll hook you up!*

st "Well, Mister Lincoln, he looked pleased as peach, said that'd be real nice. Dad, he had something like ten stripes. Golly, Mister Lincoln would'a been able to do plenty with that!"

st Dani clapped her paws gleefully at the story. "Wonderful! You've got the entire thing set up, right there. I feel like I get close so often, but I just don't quite get it to stick the whole way through."

st They were as two girls at a sleepover, stretched out on their fronts on a beanbag, a book propped up before them both.

st It was Amy's turn to laugh. "You do get close, yeah. You're just missing mechanics. Like, y'gotta start telling little side stories, no more than a sentence long, to buy yourself some time. We don't care what Mister Lincoln does with the stripes, but we make something up to give us time to, uh...stick our landing, I guess."

st "Yeah, I can't even begin to think of how to do that." Dani shrugged, stretching her tail out carefully and wincing. "If I don't go into the story with the whole thing already written, I'm more than likely just going to run myself in circles trying to think of all of the archetypes."

st Amy looked as though she was cuing up a response to that, perhaps some list of improvements for Dani to follow. The otter interrupted, both of her paws clutching at Amy's. She almost had the ringtail clocked. Shelved, cataloged, organized.

st "You, see, you're eighty one. Here you are, plowing through the world, and you're doing really good. You find yourself on the road, and you got yourself some friends, or maybe just one. Just someone you're traveling with."

st Amy shut down at this outburst, her expression going blank and her paws going slack in Dani's.

st The otter persisted. "You said, *It's so wonderful out now, I must be all set for the next year.*

st "But you were with someone, weren't you? Someone at Open Door? He had a home, or money, something he could offer, he could..." Dani trailed off. "Shit, I'm sorry. I went way too far, there."

st The otter tried to tug her paws back to herself, to withdraw. Drunk on storytelling was a new sensation for her. She hadn't expected it would lead to such an overreach. She hadn't expected it to drop her barriers around classification.

st Amy clutched at Dani's paws, shaking her head. It was a confused gesture, a sad gesture. "No, you're right. He's down at Open Door."

st Ears pinned back and whiskers sleeked in against her cheeks, Dani continued haltingly. "You didn't...you didn't prep for the winter because summer was easy. He had, so he kept you in his debt."

st The ringtail's grip tightened around Dani's paws.

st There was nothing the otter could say to continue.

st "So he pulls me aside, he says *we just need to keep ourselves warm.*" Amy's voice was quiet, hoarse. "And that sounds good to me. But I have to do something in return. Something for him. So I think to myself, *Aha, I've got a plan.*"

st Dani returned the squeeze of paws. Amy wasn't looking at her any longer, staring toward the blank wall with a smile that's more rictus than the jolly grin her story would imply.

st "*Don't worry. I'll hold up the roof,* I tell him. So I hide myself away up in the attic, tell him I'm doing something useful, when all the while, I'm making sure I can get away without giving him everything he asks."

st There was a silence between them, then. True silence. Neither had anything to say, and neither could offer any path forward.

st It took a good five minutes for the moment to pass. Amy's expression cycled through vacant amusement, thinly veiled anger, and despair. Dani, frozen where she was with the strained tail, could only hold on to the ringtail's paws and hope that she hadn't screwed up too badly.

st "That--" Amy coughed, clearing her throat and sitting up. "That got a little too real. Alright if we switch to a movie or something?"

st Dani nodded and bowed her head, gesturing in the direction of the shelves of DVDs. "Take your pick."

st -----

st Dani stayed silent through the movie. Amy had chosen a thriller, something with enough action to hold their interest without demanding it. Not *too* actiony, not too cerebral.

st The ringtail had shrunk in size, Dani noticed, all her confidence drained away. The jokey story-telling exercise really had gone too far, and although she stood by her assessment, she realized she probably should have been a bit more careful of providing it.

st All of that openness that had grown over the past few hours, all of that was slowly unwound. She had built up this stanchion of confidence, only to find she'd planned the bridge in the wrong spot. She'd hoped to understand Amy.

st She hadn't had a goal in this sleepover storytime, but even so, she'd screwed it up.

st She spent her time pretending to leaf through the book of motifs and tropes. Amy sat where she had been, watching the TV over Dani as the otter poked through her book. She didn't have quite what it took to look Amy in the eyes.

st *Perhaps I should find her a place to go,* she thought. *Perhaps this whole thing was a mistake. We don't know each other, neither of us know how to share.*

st And yet they stayed there. Amy watched her movie, and Dani's eyes traced lines of text without reading them.

st Dani perked up enough to watch the climax of the movie, canting her ears back enough so that the movie isn't all she heard. She'd seen it dozens of times already. She was more interested in Amy's thoughts than in the movie itself.

st The denouement of the film was swift. A proper thriller, she decided long ago, should leave several threads hanging. Explain too much, and you get a detective story. Explain too little and you get...well, a mess. You get her life. Too many things independently explained which do nothing to provide a sense of the whole, nothing that adds up to a plot.

st Amy seemed to melt beside her, slouching first toward one side, then stretching her legs out, and finally slipping down onto the beanbag. It was more of a collapse than a deliberate movement, but at least it was something.

st "You okay?" Dani asked, setting her book down off to the side.

st Nothing but the sounds of the ringtail settling into the beanbag bed. It was her bed, even. Dani's was around the corner in the bedroom.

st The otter carefully squirmed onto her side, doing all she could not to tweak her tail more than she already had. She would need to get up to use the bathroom a some point, but for now, she considered herself stuck.

st *Might as well fix this, while we're here.*

st "You okay, Amy?"

st "Amber."

st Dani hesitated for a moment before murmuring, "Is that your name now?"

st "No, that's my name. Just Amber."

st The ringtail's voice was flat, her eyes downcast, and even then focusing on nothing. It hurt to listen to.

st "Did I go too far?"

st "No, you're fine."

st Dani watched the way Amber's eyes went in and out of focus. They never shifted the direction in which they were looking, but it was still plain enough to see her thoughts shifting instead.

st "You want to know something?" Dani asked.

st The ringtail lifted her gaze enough to look at Dani properly. "Mm."

st "I don't think your story is eighty one, like I said. It's fifty eight."

st Amy--Amber's ears tilted back. Short, sharp condemnations.

st Dani pressed on all the same. She tried to pick up on the smooth confidence of Amber when she had told stories, tried to slip into the same casual language. "You're the one who sees something on the far bank that she wants. You have a goal, something you could really desire. Not just a passing fancy."

st Amber's expression softened.

st "So you think, *Ah, there we go! Just what I was after.* But it's on the far bank, right? So you look around and you see the crocodile. He's a good kid, you know. The type of person who would try to do right by you, even if he doesn't get the whole story.

st "Well now, you've got a means, and you've got a goal, but you don't have the influence to make it happen. So you sit down by the crocodile and you say, *Great day out here, really nice.* And he says, *Yup.* And it's not a great start and all, but you know it's gonna take a while to sway the crocodile's interests to align with yours.

st "*I always find myself thinking of the far bank, of what that would bring me, what I could gain by being there.* The croc frowns. Each bank is the same to him. The river is as valid as land, when it comes to crossing.

st "*All I think about,* the croc says. *Is how I'm going to meet someone. Come to a river, and you've got a one dimensional dating pool. I can't meet anyone across the river I can't meet on this side. The river's not that wide.*"

st Amber was grinning outright, though she stayed quiet to let Dani finish her telling.

st "And that crocodile, well, you know he was kind of an jerk. All he was thinking about was what he'd get out of the deal. Sometimes that's good and all, like you want to get to the other side too, right?

st "Still, you've got goals other than just *Hey, just looking for a lay.*"

st Amber's grin gets tight, a bit mean, but no less earnest.

st "So you give it a bit of thought, and you duck off down the bank, and you put your hard-earned basket-weaving skills to use, and you come up with a present for the crocodile.

st "*Tell you what, buddy,* you say. *I know a bunch of folks on both sides of the river. I've got a guy on the other side, he says he knows someone. I think she's even on this side of the river.*

st "The croc laughs, and comes back at you with. *Why don't you just send her my way, then?*

st "*Well, it's not that easy, duh, or I would'a. I don't know the girl, I just know my guy, he says he knows all sorts of these girls.* You give this big, exasperated sigh. *Look, just get me over there, and I'll get this all sorted out with my buddy. We both want that, right?*"

st The ringtail was fully engaged now, laughing and rolling her eyes and nodding along with Dani.

st "You can always tell when a guy's just after one thing, so you just need to point it out to him. Anyway, that's what you've done, and your friendly croc bud helps you across the river. That thing's deep, and you could swim, but that'd suck.

st "Crocodile dude drops you off at the far shore, and sure as hell, you're closer to where you want to be. *Sweet, thanks,* you say. *My buddy here, he says that you've got someone already waiting for you on the other side. She's heard all about you, if you know what I mean. See? there she is now!*

st "And you point across the river. There, just across on the other side, poking just out over the water, is the snout of another crocodile! Well, your dude, he gives you the biggest thumbs up and tackiest wink one could manage, and starts back across the river with your blessing.

st "That's your crocodile on the other side, after all. You made her out of reeds, built up from whole cloth, and now here you are, where you need to be. What your dude does with his very flammable wife is up to him. You've done your part."

st Amber laughed outright at that last bit, and Dani grinned happily in response.

st "I'll give you a nine out of ten on delivery on that one," the ringtail said. "You sold me at the end there, but at the beginning, it sounded like an apology."

st "Yeah." Dani grinned sheepishly. "I'm sorry, Amber."

st "It's cool, I swear."

st "So what about the story?"

st "Oh, that gets a ten out of ten."

st Dani laughed. "Oh yeah?"

st "Of course! I think your earlier story was true, too, but this one's better. I got here, didn't I? I got what I wanted."

st The otter went quiet at that, tilting her head. "How do you mean?"

st Amber shrugged. "I got here. I made it across the Rockies, and I have a few more, uh...rivers to cross, but I got here with a bunch of help, like that dick back at the shelter."

st Dani nodded, waited.

st "It cost a lot. More than I want to say. But I can move on from that."

st The otter gathered up the ringtail's paws in her own and gave them a squeeze. "You sure you're okay? You safe from that guy?"

st "I think so, yeah." Amber nodded. "He's too 'interested in experiences, rather than people.' He can go off and get more of those, while I get what I want."

st Dani nodded, and let the silence linger on. Finally, she screwed up the courage to add, "You can stay here, too, you know. Long as you need."

st Amber laughed easily. "Thank you. You've done so much for me."

st "Does that make me your crocodile?" Dani shot back, grinning.

st The ringtail didn't respond verbally, but rather leaned in and give Dani a kiss.

st Dani froze. It was completely out of the blue, though perhaps some part of her suspected it was coming. The tension had been a thing, of course, but had always been on her end. She hadn't expected a homeless girl to be giving her a kiss, no matter the stories that surrounded it.

st All the same, the otter relented, shifting more onto her side and ignoring the twinge in her tail. When presented with a kiss, there was no further categorization to be done. They were kissing, and that was that.

st The moment shifted, and Amber leaning back away from Dani. The otter plastered her whiskers back against her muzzle with a little 'huff'. She couldn't hide just how much the kiss had affected her, but she could at least distract from the fact.

st "Tell me your name."

st Amber smiled. It was a soft and kind smile, open and honest. "Amber."

st "I'm not going to wake up to a different name, am I?"

st "Would you like to?"

st Dani laughed. "Probably not. If your goal was to subvert me organizing everything too much, you did it. This, though--" and she leaned forward to give Amber another quick kiss. "I'd like to hold onto this."

st The ringtail smiled, looking happier than before, with nose nearly pressed in against Dani's. "'Amber's real, don't worry. That's my true name."

st Her whiskers bristling from the close contact, Dani smiled. "What power does that grant me, knowing that?"

st "What power would you like?"

st "Flight?"

st Amber laughed.

st "Seeing through walls, maybe?" Dani continued. "Precognition? Pyrokinesis? That might be nice with it being this cold."

st "And dangerous, probably."

st It was Dani's turn to laugh. "Okay, yeah, probably."

st The ringtail propped herself up on an elbow, resting her cheek in her paw. "Okay, how about company, then? I can give you the power to not be alone, at least for a bit."

st "I don't know if that's a power, really, but I'm more than happy for it."

st Amber shrugged and grinned down to the otter, "Good. I don't feel very powerful. I don't grant wishes or anything, but it's good to be here."

st "Mm," Dani agreed.

st Amber paused, then laughed. "And this is the point when you kiss me again."

st -----

st When Dani awoke early the next morning --- very early, far before even her alarms --- she was alone. Amber was gone.

st When she thought of the last few days, she wasn't totally surprised. The parable from the night before had been accurate enough: Amber had gotten to the other side of the cold snap. Dani would be left grappling with the Amber-that-was, the Amy and the Alex and the Anne, for a while yet, but Amber was on her way.

st Not surprised, but not happy. She had set aside that overarching need to categorize and order her life for someone, and now they were gone. It hadn't been a one-night stand, hadn't been a fling. It wasn't a relationship, though Dani would have welcomed that. It had been a closeness borne of cold and necessity.

st She clumsily paced her apartment for a few hours, that Tuesday. The university was still closed for the remainder of the cold snap, though the temperature was now well above zero. She suspected it was more of an issue about the boiler than the temperature. Either way, she was still all wobbly from the strain in her tail.

st She made coffee.

st She took a nap.

st There was nothing she could do to follow Amber. There was nothing she *would* do to follow her. Amber had moved on, and Dani was left to deal with what remained. Dani could no more follow her than the crocodile could. She was bound for the other shore, for more loneliness and more dreams.

st She put a movie to playing.

st She cleaned the kitchen and picked up all the blankets on the beanbag.

st Every step of the way had been noted and slotted into its own comfortable box.

st Dani, as a person, was easily classified, but Amber...she was wholly uncategorizable.

st She checked the clothes dryer, but it was empty, with the clothes she'd lent Amber piled beneath, so she did a load of laundry

st She slowly reorganized her life around this Amber-shaped hole, patching together feelings into a new whole.

st And the only thing missing was her catalog of folktales.
