\chapter{Tuesday, December 22nd -- Evening}

Justin didn't show up for dinner.

With the way that the weekend had gone, Jeff halfway expected him to be gone, back to the house across the street.  Even so, he made sure he got Kayla fed with some simple out-of-the-box maccaroni and cheese with some broccoli steamed in the microwave.  He shovelled a quick few bites of dinner into his mouth, knowing that that, as much as his coat, would help keep him from freezing in the deep cold that he was learning would permeate the east coast throughout the cold winter months.

At the coat closet, he was pleased to see Justin's coat missing.  His son hadn't talked in days, had barely slept, barely ate, but at least he had the sense to bring his coat with him.

Shrugging into his parka, he leaned down to kiss Kalya atop her head.  ``Daddy's going to go look for Justin.  I'll clean up the dishes when I get back.  I won't be long, Kay-bear, he's probably just across the street.''

Kayla was silent as she looked up to her father.

Jeff hesitated, then leaned down to give one more kiss against his daughter's forehead.  ``I'll be back soon, promise.''

When the silence continued, Jeff offered a weak smile before turning and twisting the arms of his parka to let it sit more comfortably around his arms.  He made his way toward the door as he worked on zipping up.

He felt torn between his two children and the seemingly vast difference in their needs.  Both had adopted a sort of impenetrable silence since the move, something that they seemed loath to crack while at home.  Bringing them out to eat elsewhere would see that silence thaw somewhat, but by the time they made their way back home, they would clam up once more.

Kayla, always the artist, would soon find her way back to the kitchen table with a small sheaf of papers, intensely drawing flower after flower after flower.  Columbines, lilies, countless flowers that I couldn't name.  They started as simple doodles, spiraling petals around an indistinct core that children have been drawing for what must be centuries, but the more I saw her digging through her book of local flowers, and doing what must've obviously been research on her phone, the more intricate the drawings got.

The drawings were beautiful, sometimes taking up entire sheets of paper with the weaving tendrils of morning glories, sometimes a simple doodle in the corner of a sheet of what might have otherwise been homework.  They were never finished, however.  She never erased any of the lines that she drew, leading to the correct lines being drawn in darker than the ones that she had deemed in correct.  They were never in color, always the simple, shining gray of her mechanical pencil.  Often, this added to their beauty in an austere sort of way, but most of the times, Jeff felt vaguely unnerved by the art that his daughter seemed to be churning out.  It was cold.  It was as lacking in depth as their conversation.

Justin was even more of an enigma to him.  He would come home and trudge upstairs to his room and quietly shut the door without a word to his father or sister.  He would usually sleep -- Jeff would hear him snoring quietly -- and stay asleep until after Jeff and Kayla went to bed.

The first few times that Justin had done this, Jeff stayed awake until Justin had woken up, some time around two or three in the morning.  When he awoke, Justin would creep downstairs and help himself to a small plate of whatever Jeff had prepared for dinner, head back up to his room, and eat there.  Occasionally, there would be music, just barely audible, heard above the soft tink of fork against plate.

Jeff had stopped staying up after a while.

%%% The first gate: fear

Bustling out of the door and shutting it carefully behind him, he stood on the front step of the house under the warm glow of the porch light and stared up.  The sky was closed in by a dense layer of cloud, reflecting back a pale yellow glow from the lights of the neighborhood.  \textit{It might snow before Christmas}, he thought, \textit{though the sky has been socked in like this for the last week and a half.}

He shook himself out of his reverie and peered across the street without dark-adjusted eyes, struggling to discerne any speck of light among the pale framing of the unfinished house, cold in the evening air.

He was frightened, he realized.  He had been frightened for months.  All of the strange and awful feelings that surrounded living in this new place, all of the ways that his children had withdrawn from him, made him realize in one shining moment that he had no idea what it was that was going on.  No idea, and that terrified him.

He felt his heart drawn to the lonely hulk of the unfinished house.  It was painful, not knowing what he could do to help his eldest, and the terror seemed only to build within him.  He wanted only to find Justin and bring him back home, wrap his two kids and himself up in a comforter in front of the TV and watch a movie, let them fall asleep against each side of him.

\textit{Damnit, Jeff,} he shook his head once more and stomped his feet to make sure they hadn't fallen asleep.  \textit{Dawdling.}  He stood still and huffed out a few more steamy breaths into the night, wondering why it was that he didn't actually want to cross the street.  He didn't want to go to his son.

He didn't want to go to his son.

He wanted his son to never have left.  He didn't want to go to him.

The thought took his breath away.  His heart ached for Justin, craved the idea of having him back home, and yet he did not want to go.  He was horrified -- horrified at himself, terrified of crossing the street.  Every bit of his soul strained toward where he now knew his son must be hiding, and yet it felt as though every fiber of his being craved collapsing back into the house behind him, where it might be safe.

Just when he thought he might actually collapse, there was the feeling of something letting go, releasing him.  It came with a rush of warmth travelling up his neck to his face, brushing past him in one smooth wave that left him feeling suddenly clear-headed.  He stumbled against the jamb of the door and shook his head, clearing the last of the cobwebs away.

He was certain Justin was across the street, now.  He was certain that he had to get him.
