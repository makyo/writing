%%% The encounter
Jeff clutched at his daughter's hand, then thought better of it and knelt beside her, hugging her protectively against his side.  She was still sobbing from the pain and rush of heat.

``Justin?  Justin, is that you?'' he called out.

There was a rustle from over by the far doorway, the one that led out into what would have been the backyard.  There was a form standing, shown only by the dull yellow of far away street-lights against clouds.

Perhaps standing was the wrong word.  From his vantage point on the foundation, kneeling next to his daughter, he could see that it was Justin, but his son was\ldots{}floating?  Hovering? His feet were flat, a scant few inches above the ground, but he wasn't touching anything else to keep him from resting on the ground.

``Justin!'' Jeff called again.  ``Come home, Justin.  It's daddy.  Come home with dad.''

Hesitating once more, he tried, ``Justin?''

``Os\'e.''

The voice that came from where his son stood was more than just his son.  It was as though Justin had whispered the word, but along with that in chorus with the boy was a voice far deeper, far older, speaking perfectly in time with him.

``O-Oh say?'' Jeff stammered.

``Os\'e,'' the voice repeated, layered above Justin's.  ``I am.  I am Os\'e.''
