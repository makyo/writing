\chapter{Late August}

``Did you practice?''

Justin stared down at his dinner, a one-pot chicken and noodle dish that Jeff had perfected in the years of raising his children, spooning up small bits of chicken and ignoring most everything else.  Not their favorite, but it at least passed muster after a day of work, for Jeff, and school shopping in the evening for the kids.

``Justin, I'm not upset,'' Jeff sighed, composing himself so as to reflect that.  ``I'm just curious why you didn't get into band.''

Justin shrugged in response, his shoulders sinking lower than they had already.

``I mean, come on, man.  You don't think it's a little weird that you spend all those years focusing on this thing, and then suddenly it's just gone?''

``I tried practicing,'' Justin mumbled.

``And?''

The boy languidly picked at his dinner, found another bite of chicken, and ate that, not responding.

Jeff sighed.  ``Hey, I'm sorry, Justin.  I know the move hasn't been great for you, but you just seemed to have so much fun with band.''  He poked around in his dish, chewed a mouthful of food thoughtfully, and tried a different tack.  ``You said you tried practicing.  Just not feeling it, bud?''

Justin shook his head, bangs shifting over his brow to hide his face.  Another wan bite of chicken and more silence.

The table sat in near silence for a bit, the only sound that of Kayla poking around her empty bowl with her fork, drawing something in the cream-of-mushroom-soup gravy that was left in the dish.  A flower.  Jeff took the opportunity to clear his own plate, keeping an eye on his son, who managed at least half of his food, Jeff's measure of `at least enough'.

When Jeff finished his last bite, Kayla leapt from her seat and picked up her bowl, fork clattering against the rim.  ``All done, all done!'' she cried, trooping off to the sink to deposit her bowl there.

Jeff settled onto his elbows, leaning over the table toward Justin and lowering his head so that he could see under the boy's bangs.  ``Everything alright, kiddo?''

Justin hesitated a moment before shaking his head, slowly scooting his chair back and standing up, shuffling over to the kitchen.  He scraped the last of his food back into the pot -- it would become leftovers for lunch the next day -- and set his bowl into Kayla's.  Making his way slowly out of the kitchen, he shuffled down the hall and closed his bedroom door quietly after himself.

All that was left was the soft noise of the radio playing in the living room, where Kayla was drawing.

Jeff sat back in his chair and frowned at the bowl ahead of him.  He'd call the school tomorrow, without letting his son know, and see what was up, if his new teachers had noticed anything about how he was feeling during the day.

Jeff never did manage to call the school, the next morning.  He'd hit snooze on his alarm and wound up cutting breakfast time a little short.  Hustling the kids and drinking some too-hot coffee a little too fast, he'd gotten the children to their schools and made it into the office by eight, but only just.

``Perez!  Sneaking in just under the line, huh?''

Jeff whirled in the lobby of the small architectural firm, the reason he'd moved across the country in the first place.

``Mr. Pike!''  Jeff tugged his jacket straight and corrected his posture, holding out his hand to the company's owner just coming through the front door.

Mr. Pike smiled and shook Jeff's hand, then clapped his left on Jeff's shoulder.  ``Chill, Jeff, you're fine.  No need to rush.  We've got half an hour before all-hands, and as long as you're not consistently late, no one really cares.''

There was the soft sound of the doors opening behind them, and two others -- higher up in seniority than Jeff, judging by their suits -- sauntered past them and offered a greeting, ``Mr. Pike, Jeff.''

``See?  Even the boss can afford to dally in the lobby.''

Jeff smiled faintly, but nodded.  The boss's reassurances aside, he still felt compelled to make a good impression early on, especially if he planned on making a name for himself in the business down the line.

He trooped into the office after his boss, slipping out of his jacket to let it dangle from his hand.
