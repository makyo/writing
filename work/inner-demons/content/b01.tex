\chapter{Early November}

``Oh!  Kayla!  Those are beautiful!''

Kayla looked up, dully at first, from the crocus she had been drawing, one among many, in a sea of graphite.  Recognizing the voice as Mrs. Willis, she had brightened and smiled, setting her pencil down and shuffling the papers nervously.

``You think so, Mrs. W?''

Mrs. Willis beamed down to Kayla.  ``They're beautiful, dear.  Where did you learn to draw like that?''

Kayla shrugged, her feet swinging, crossed at the ankles, beneath her chair.  ``I just draw a lot.  Daddy draws, and so I started drawing, and now it's just what I love to do.''

``They're beautiful,'' Mrs. Willis reaffirmed, then paused.  ``The class is scheduled to move to clay tomorrow.  Do you want to work with clay?  I can let you do clay flowers, if that's what you like, instead of the slab pottery.''

Kayla, thought about that.  The thoughts were crowded with flowers.  Perfect curves along petals, the gentle arc of a stem softened by trichomes.  Colors that seemed to blur within her head.

``I-'' she began, then stopped once more.

Perhaps sensing the remainder of the thought, Mrs. Willis took stock of the rest of the class, drawing inverted images as a study of negative space, though she hadn't introduced that term yet.  Other than a young boy and girl trying desparately not to look like they were talking across the room, everyone was behaving well.

``Come, Kayla.  Come with me.  I want to have a word with you in the hall,'' she murmured quietly.

Kayla flushed, gave one last look to her flowers, and nodded, carefully scooting her chair back from the edge of the desk.  She followed after her teacher, mindful lifting her feet too high.  It was best to move among flowers in a flowing fashion, with grace so as not to crush any.

Once outside, Mrs. Willis closed the door most of the way after one last look, then appraised her student.  ``Do you know what an `independent study' is, Ms. Perez-Gray?''

Kayla stared at her feet (surrounded by dandeliions -- delicate flowers of all yellow on a sturdy stalk) until the words `independent study' caught her attention.  ``Mmn?  No.''

``It means that a student gets to direct their own study into a field that they love.''  Mrs. Willis peered down through her glasses at the young girl, ``You have an interest -- a thing that you love -- and you have the will to make something beautiful.  Would you like to do an independent study?''

Kayla poked her toe against the linoleum (against the green leaves at the base of a dandelion) and thought for a moment, ``What does that mean?''

Mrs. Willis face softened into kindness.  ``It means that I would give you resources to learn how to draw and paint flowers.  Some books, some examples.  Georgia O'Keefe\ldots{}no, not yet.  Anyway, dear, I'll give you some examples and books on drawing flowers, and you and I will come up with some goals for you to reach, and you can work towards that, rather than following the curriculum of the rest of the class.  Does that make sense to you, Ms. Perez-Gray?''

The flowers were so fragrant.  They smelled like muffins.  The color drained from them down into the linoleum, then flowed back into them from the ceiling.  Yellow and green -- gray -- yellow and green.

Kayla nodded.

``Good.''  Mrs. Willis smiled brightly.  ``I'll write your father a note during class today.  You can bring it to him and it will explain what we plan on doing.  I'll leave a spot for a signature at the bottom so that you can have him sign it.  Bring it back to me, okay Kayla?  So that I know he's alright with our little plan.''

Kayla felt neither relief nor upset, nor anything really.  She was overwhelmed by the heady scent of a field of dandelions, coarsely toothed leaves brushing against her ankles and reminding her that this was good, that this was right.

``I will, Mrs. W.''  She smiled at the tickling of the leaves against her, the sensation seeming to pass through her socks and sneakers.  ``I will.  Thank you, Mrs. W.  I want to draw more.''
