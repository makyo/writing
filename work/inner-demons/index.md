Jeff Perez has just moved to a new city and a new state with his two children.  While he begins the process of adaptation just fine, his children have more trouble.  Kayla disappears into the world of her art and Justin appears to be having more trouble.  Much more trouble, and of a harder to understand nature.  There's only so much a single father can do, but as the world around them gets more and more horrifying, Jeff finds himself doing everything in his power to keep his family safe.
