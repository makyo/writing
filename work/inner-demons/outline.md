Father starts reading about demonology in some book, oldest son is depressed, haunting starts, gets worse over time, resolution is demon from book starts trashing everything in this guys life, solution is they all have to go to demon (in relative's house? estranged wife?), surrounded by perfect calm and everything in it's place wherever they go, tell son to kill himself, demon is stopped, but with laughter, exactly as it had said in the book. Everything back to normal, only the family remembers what happened, only thing different is oldest son still dead of suicide, book is missing

-----

* Act 1
    * Moving to new house
        * Why? Single father, architect, new job maybe?
    * New schools
        * two kids, younger daughter and older son
    * Beginning of signs that son is depressed, not just upset over move
        * Makes it through a quarter, hasn't joined extracurricular activities, no friends - all expected, but also stops listening to music, starts occasionally missing dinner, etc.
* Act 2
    * Haunting starts
        * dreams for everyone, starting with and most intensely affecting daughter
    * son starts spending time at half-constructed abandoned house next door reading and thinking, much, much more depressed
        * initial worries about drugs, but the lack of any social connections, much less drug connections puts lie to that
        * father sits with him a few times at the old house, finding him sitting with a book, the same book each time, but with very little progress in reading, just staring and feeling awful.
        * the opposite of depression is vitality - son already starting to seem dead inside, except for the hurting.
    * Haunting starts to pick up with actual occurrences at home - smell of smoke, phantom touches, etc, difficult for painfully rational dad
* Act 3
    * Kid goes missing for dinner, then further - 3am
    * The story of getting to the son with the daughter - the tribulations of making it out of the relative safety of the home to the abandoned house next door
        * passing through 'gates' to reach him
        * slick and oily, feeling dirty, making the feeling of cleanliness that Kayla feels mentioned in the epilogue more important
    * encounter with demon and son's suicide
        * discussion with demon
        * son's suicide
        * demon's laughter
* Epilogue
    * who knows what happened.  Writing a letter/journal, trying to get ideas out?
        * When David heard that Absolom was slain, he went up into his chamber over the gate and cried, "My son, my son, would God I had died for thee"
        * Daughter won't talk except at school (how much of this is the father being crushed versus the daughter's own grief?)
