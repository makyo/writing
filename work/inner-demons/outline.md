Family moves, oldest son is depressed, haunting starts, gets worse over time, solution is they all have to go to demon, surrounded by perfect calm and everything in it's place wherever they go, tell son to kill himself, demon is stopped, but with laughter, exactly as it had willed. Everything back to normal, only the family remembers what happened, only thing different is oldest son still dead of suicide

Really, the story is about Jeff (and thus, the reader) being totally unable to comprehend what Justin is going through.  It is big and horrifying and totally inaccessible to anyone but Justin.  The ultimate folly is not asking for help.

-----

* Act 1
    * Moving to new house
        * Why? Single father, architect, new job maybe?
    * New schools
        * two kids, younger daughter and older son
    * Beginning of signs that son is depressed, not just upset over move
        * Makes it through a quarter, hasn't joined extracurricular activities, no friends - all expected, but also stops listening to music, starts occasionally missing dinner, etc.
* Act 2
    * Haunting starts
        * dreams for everyone, starting with and most intensely affecting daughter
    * son starts spending time at half-constructed abandoned house next door reading and thinking, much, much more depressed
        * initial worries about drugs, but the lack of any social connections, much less drug connections puts lie to that
        * father sits with him a few times at the old house, finding him sitting with a book, the same book each time, but with very little progress in reading, just staring and feeling awful.
        * the opposite of depression is vitality - son already starting to seem dead inside, except for the hurting.
    * Kayla starts drawing flowers
        * draws the attention of her art teacher, who gives her encouragement
        * Conversations about the source of art - "Where are you getting this?" "From inside my head" "but what is your inspiration?" "Flowers.  Fields full of flowers.  Organized and disorganized," etc
    * Haunting starts to pick up with actual occurrences at home - smell of smoke, phantom touches, etc, difficult for painfully rational dad
    * Start searching for new house, no one is happy here for more obvious reasons than it being new.
* Act 3
    * Justin goes missing for dinner
    * The story of getting to the son with the daughter - the tribulations of making it out of the relative safety of the home to the abandoned house next door
        * passing through 'gates' to reach him - falls to ground with each gate
            1. Fear
            2. Anger (invisible resistance)
            3. Tears
            4. Blood
            5. Fire
            6. Blackness
                * Cut to Kayla
                * Problems from her point of view, talking with teachers
                * Making her way out to her dad after midnight
            7. Filth (Kayla shows up here, time passes weird, almost 3 am) (soot, slick, oily, feeling dirty, making the feeling of cleanliness that Kayla feels mentioned in the epilogue more important)
            8. Desperation
            9. Pain
    * 3am encounter with demon and son's suicide
        * discussion with demon
        * son's suicide
        * demon's laughter
* Epilogue
    * who knows what happened.  Writing a letter/journal, trying to get ideas out?
        * When David heard that Absolom was slain, he went up into his chamber over the gate and cried, "My son, my son, would God I had died for thee"
        * Daughter won't talk except at school (how much of this is the father being crushed versus the daughter's own grief?)
    * Left over:
        * burnt and singed hair
        * memories
        * the feeling of grease and dirt that never quite comes clean
