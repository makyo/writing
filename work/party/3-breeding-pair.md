# Breeding Pair

Matthew Lederer had been prowling around the outer edges of the BDSM party circuit for a few months now. Although he still called himself a transplant, he'd been in the area for almost three years, and the excuse had started to wear thin. He was more than past due to get back to the explorations he'd left behind with the move.

There had been some false starts, as there were with any venture. The first party he'd found had turned out to be a such a bust that he'd almost given up and gone back to a regular dating scene after that. "BDSM party", to some, apparently meant getting *really high* and having *a lot of sex* while seemingly trying to be *as unsafe as possible*.

Not his bag.

After that, he'd started asking around before simply hunting for them on some of the skeevier sites on the web. Having face-to-face conversations seemed to really help eliminate the grosser of the parties.

There were some good times and some awkward times after that, but no downright bad times. He'd played a bit here and there, exploring how to safely engage his dommy side, and, on two occasions, gotten himself delightfully tied up. And always, as he asked around at the parties, people talked in an almost worshipful tone of Joan and Elise's parties, and how well they seemed to run.

His in had been through Joan herself, let off the leash to go have some fun of her own while Elise had a night of recharging and wine at home. They'd gotten to talking after the party, two mustelids lounging on a couch. It had been too warm (and too messy) to really cuddle, but they'd sort of made the gestures without actually making contact, avoiding building up heat while still being close.

She'd asked him if he'd be interesting in coming to a similar party at her place before he'd even put two and two together, and he'd said yes.

More luck than sense, but that's how it works at the end of BDSM parties.

Joan had given him a feathery kiss to the whiskers at the end of the night and they'd promise to see each other a month and change down the line. Matthew'd caught the bus home after that, reeking of sex, head buzzy with pleasure and filled with endorphins from the pain (there had been flogging), thinking of that lithe ferret he'd had the chance to close out the evening with. He suspected she was quite out of his league, but the kiss and the invitation had him hopeful.

The next five weeks had been a tortuous slog through work. Work itself was picking up, which sucked, and seemed to be getting in the way of all his plans, cancelling at least one tentative date between the two parties. Thankfully, the product reveal was two days before the party itself, so perhaps that would be a little treat. He suspected he'd need the release by then.

He had long since gotten used to being greeted by the smells of arousal and stress when walking into parties like this, but tonight there was something more, something that touched him in a way those other mixed scents before hadn't. To then be greeted at the party by his coworker --- his coworker! --- and his delightful mink of a wife in the midst of disrobing left him reeling.

"And this is Matthew. Matthew Lederer," Aaron had said. "I believe you've met."

Matthew knew he was staring, open mouthed. He'd known Erin was attractive. That much was obvious at the silly company party they'd all had to attend, but now she seemed decidedly stunning.

She was at the end of a leash held by Aaron, a black, nylon job that was clasped to an identical collar. All the silver and black went well with her sleek fur.

She was still dressed much as she had been the first time they'd met, other than that, and the incongruence brought a smile to his muzzle. It was less the clothing, then that drew him to her, but the scent of her own arousal: that which had him bristling from entry. It felt like a complement to him. Something that ought to be *his*.

He forced himself to turn to Aaron and grin widely to him rather than simply leering at the cat's wife. "Good to see you here, buddy! And yeah, I believe we have. Wasn't expecting to be so lucky in my choice of toys for tonight."

"Mmhm," Aaron offered, brushing the handle of the leash over the bridge of Erin's muzzle. "Was my turn to bring the Centerpiece. Just about to go get her all trussed up. But here, stand up straighter, minkytoy."

Matthew found himself tense, grinning. Far tenser than he remembered getting. He forced himself to relax with a slow breath and watched as Erin straightened her back and lifted her head, looking bashful.

"The Centerpiece should greet all her guests while she still can," Aaron continued. "Go on."

The other mink nodded and gave Matthew a shy hug and a kiss to his muzzle. That scent grew stronger, and Matthew returned that kiss eagerly.

"W-welcome," Erin said, meek.

All this mention of 'toy', the degrading language, it was all so easy to pick up.

"Thank you, er..." He made a show of leaning forward to check the tag on Erin's collar. Another heady whiff of that scent --- arousal, need, mink.  "Thank you, toy. I'm sure I'll be most welcome indeed."
