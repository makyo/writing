MedRes Ship Rodriguez Med Alpha Niner --- her name was Arianna, but only HR knew that, and sometimes even she forgot --- clutched her paws shut until stubby nails dug into pads. This was not how it was supposed to go.

She'd been working at her post for nearly fifteen years, and had yet to experience any sort of disaster of this scale, nor any so...complex. In space, most disasters are either handled with efficiency by on-board medres folks or so catastrophic as to leave no one left to handle them at all. The medical/rescue ships were usually dispatched to either treat any wounded or clean up debris (or, failing that, nudge it into the atmosphere). The 'rescue' portion of their job was tacked on to their job description to make the general population feel well taken care of.

And yet here she was, socketed into her suit, which was socketed into her EVAR, staring out across the mess of ship-bits highlighted against her visor.

The debris field stretched across an spheroid two kilometers wide at its widest. The Rodriguez was still station-keeping at fifteen kilometers away, per regulations --- no reason to risk that as well --- but the magnified and highlighted view showed what appeared to be two ships complicated by the wreckage of a third.

The wreckage was a wash, and Med knew it. Their job was to figure out what was going on with the two other ships. Dispatch had said there was one MilDef in place and intact, overseeing the damaged passenger vessel and the lost cargo ship.

Military/Defense. First of those she'd seen.

The MilDef ships were spherical with powerful engines recessed within their hull and attitude jets in rings along three axes. Their weapons were centered opposite the main engines to allow compensation for what recoil from the more powerful stuff on board. Despite the fact that they looked rather like matte black balloons, they were so adroit, so feared, that they inspired something far less than joy in most spacers' eyes.

There were only three of those in use. Expensive balloons.

The passenger ship was one of those powered rotation ring models that moved its cargo of people and mods under gravity in comfort. This was less true now, of course. Only one quadrant of the ring seems to have survived, with the antipodal one shredded and the two adjacent quadrants dark and open to space. The command bulb still had lights, though. That was a good sign.

The cargo ship was now shrapnel, but readouts suggested it'd been of a dated string-of-cans make.

That was the part that didn't make sense to A9. To destroy all three clusters of three cans would've taken some pretty intense effort. A bomb in each, perhaps, or one centered between each of the clusters, which sounded fantastically unrealistic.

No wonder MilDef was here.

"...Alpha. Attention Alpha. Attention Alpha."

A9 snapped away from speculation and back to reality. The attention command was repeated five times before a debriefing, and she'd missed more than two.

"This is situation number two-oh-one-three-dash-oh-five-dash-one-two Rodriguez one. The classification is red. The sit-rep for the operation is oh-one. The sit-rep for Alpha is A0."
