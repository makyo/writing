### Rob

Initial thoughts: Having read this a couple of times now, it’s well-written on a sentence-by-sentence and paragraph-by-paragraph level. I’m having a hard time putting my finger on the narrative of the overall piece. It feels in a way like the strongest statement is one you make about halfway through: “What to do, it turned out, was to be loud.”

That’s a really strong, really interesting statement and it does a good job serving as the axis for the whole piece. It feels a little like it’s not super well set up by the first few paragraphs (the ones that discuss oversharing or talkativeness sort of in a vacuum, or more negatively). It feels _to me_ like this would be stronger more to the end where, having established your thesis, you can discuss those obvious rejoinders and put a little more meat on them.

Because after that point, it really comes together I think… the personal examples are really just… they’re good. You do a good job of using them not to talk about yourself, although you are, but as ways of building up the case you’re making.

The ending lands a bit soft. I would maybe (irrationally?) have thought to see more on the idea of technology and the open-source community as also an “inherently social” community, and an inherently oversharing community and some discussion as to whether that made it more (or, ironically, less) of a place for people outside traditional norms in other ways. I guess, in a sense, I would have expected a bit more on tech as a mirror, or a lens, particularly given how you talk about the role Canonical played.

That said it does a good job I think of narrating the “think piece vs. personal anecdote” divide and managing to do both. I’m not sure it actually _needs_ to be one or the other.

It's very well-written; I can't say I have any stylistic criticisms. It comes across as portraying an overall positive experience for you in coming out at work, which is nice. There are a couple proofing nits -- I suspect the last line of the penultimate paragraph should be "we're doing good things" rather than "were doing," and I don't think "full circle" should be hyphenated -- but that's about it.
