title: TNS - LGBTQ+ in FOSS

I'm notoriously bad at keeping my mouth shut.

I haven't done any empirical studies, of course, but I suspect that this is a definite thing with the tech-obsessed, particularly those embedded in open source.  Perhaps it's because of how much of our products have to do with social interaction, or maybe it's just due to how much social interaction is involved in making the things that we make.

As for me, a solid millennial, I suspect that there's no small part of our loquacity that is due to a rejection of and outright rebellion against the '80s and '90s tropes of geeks as downtrodden loners worthy only of pity.  We can't seem to shut up because we've found that, by not shutting up, we actually got quite far in life.

I worry that I take it too far, sometimes.  I worry that I overshare in the name of honesty or self-care.  That's what got me into writing and my early forays into making bulletin boards, guest books, and blogs when I first started learning Perl sixteen years ago.  OCD aside, my compulsive need to share drove my interests, then my education, then my career, as I moved from Perl to PHP to Python and JavaScript, from high school to university to the workforce.

My first job out of university was working for an insurance company, designing and implementing a quoting and sales tool.  It was there that I started to find my crowd for real.  My time studying music in university was awesome, no doubt about it, but tech was where I felt like I belonged.  It was about the conversation and undirected interaction, rather than the more directed action of composer to performer to audience.

Before I left that job, I was pretty solid in my identity as a proud, even if slightly too loud, techie.  Coming out as, at the time, a gay man at work went as smooth as one could imagine, and my boss even came to my wedding and paid for the reception dinner as a gift.

Moving to work at Canonical was a way to alleviate stress as well as a way to focus more directly on the open source community, from which I had gained so much, but it was also a chance to gain enough space to really sit down and tackle a lot of identity problems, since it meant working from home.  Problems like just what the heck was I supposed to do about The Gender Thing?

One of the things to keep in mind about identity is that it is often psychopathological: it's that thing that we only really sense when it gets rubbed the wrong way, when it puts us in distress.

What to do, it turned out, was to be loud.  To keep talking, to keep interacting, and to keep finding ways to ease that friction around identity, and for me, that meant exploring the realm of transition.  After all, coming out as gay at my previous job went alright, so perhaps it was time to see how coming out as trans while I had a relatively safe situation to do so would work.

Things worked pretty smoothly, and it's a testament to a lot of the folks in open source in general and at Canonical in particular that things went as well as they did.  I began by changing my name, just informally at first.  Madison is pretty unambiguously feminine, so that was a dead giveaway early on, and my boss asked me if I was "making any other changes", to which I responded that I might in time.

This is the first thing to remember about coming out and transition: they are continual processes rather than distinct events.  The flip side of this is that although there are distinct events involved in the process, there's no end goal beyond simply being happy.

The next step was to talk with HR once my name had been legally changed.  At that point, we discussed mundanities such as insurance and accommodation at sprints as well as grander topics such as how to tell the team and what to do about any problems that might come up.  We had several long conversations, and eventually settled on me contacting team members on an individual basis at my own pace.

The second important thing to remember is that an active and involved support network can really make or break an experience with coming out or transitioning.  Having understanding and involved teammates and HR critters helps ensure that it feels like a conversation rather than a directive.  That said, everyone will have their comfort level and how much they engage is at their discretion.

Despite feeling accomplished once I'd had all of my 1:1s, I quickly realized that this would be an ongoing and continual thing.  Growing my hair out was one thing, but showing up at a sprint in a skirt and makeup was another.  Coming out was something that would happen over and over and wouldn't always be received with the same easygoing response all the time.

The last bit to bring up is that transition is inherently social, despite all the work done on an individual level.  Not just the doctor's notes, endocrinologist visits, or surgery consults, either, but a process that happens on a social level.

I guess that brings me full-circle, doesn't it?  I spent so much of my time steering my course towards tech and open source as a place worth taking that need to be social, to talk through the way life works, and to find ways to make that social interaction easier and more widely available.  I did that because it's one of the things that helped me most through life.  Tech isn't perfect, FOSS isn't perfect - we all can find ways to improve within the community - but were doing good things for good reasons.  Just keep on talking.
