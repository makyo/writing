# Tracking an anthology: the steps from start to finish

Running an anthology is no small undertaking. In 2017, I began working on the *Arcana* anthology with Thurston Howl Publications. Nine months later, I had a book with a bunch of stories that I'd helped put together. That nine months, though, was a lot of work, and sometimes a lot of waiting around. Let's talk a little about that process.

*The first step to building an anthology is coming up with the basic theme.* For *Arcana*, we had that ready made for us: the major arcana of a tarot deck gave us an arc for all stories, and each story got at theme of its own. Not all anthologies are the same, though, and some may have loser goals than others. For instance, you may have only a single guiding word to pull everything together, such as ROAR's 'resistance'.

*Once you have the theme, you need to decide on the dates.* You need to take into account how long you feel you can spend on each part of this process. When you open your call, you need to give time for your authors to write, then you need to give yourself time to finish all of the parts of the project after that, such as editing, layout, and marketing.

*When you've got your dates nailed down, you can open up for a call.* This part is broken down into a few different steps.

First of all, you'll need to write up a compelling call for submissions. In this, you may want to give your authors a bit of a taste of what you're looking for with a snippet of fiction. Or perhaps you might wish to tease them with a bit of art to set the mood. Maybe you'll want to give them a few ideas and list off some topics that they can take and run with.

You'll also need to come up with some requirements for what they're going to be writing. What wordcount do you have in mind? For *Arcana*, we mentioned that we would like stories between two- and five-thousand words, a length dictated by how many stories we would have in the final anthology (with twenty-two stories being set by the tarot itself). Consider how long you would like the book to be and how many stories you want.

Consider also aspects such as rating --- both sexuality and violence can play a role into this, too, so you might want to break this down further --- and other restrictions. It's also worth excluding some topics right away, such as stories that include homophobia, transphobia, racism, and other forms of bigotry portrayed in a positive light.

From there, you just need to open the call and wait for the date when it closes. You may need to offer some extensions, so make sure to plan for a bit of leeway.

*Great! The call has ended and you've now got a bunch of stories to read through.* Now your job is to just get comfy and start reading. Come up with a few criteria by which to judge your story: four or five numbers on a scale from one to ten that you can use to rate different aspects of a story. For instance, you can rate on publication fit, how easily a story can be edited, how evocative it is, and so on. This will allow you to tally up a score for each story that you can use when making a decision.

*Okay, lots of good stories, some not so good ones. How do you make the choice?* The scores you generated in the previous step will obviously cull a lot of stories right away: if they just didn't score high enough, they're not going to make good additions to your anthology. Still, you'll probably have to reread a few stories to make sure that they fit. It might come down to some close ties here and there, so don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion, if you're able, to see which one will work better.

*Arcana* led to what amounted to twenty-two calls, so the number of submissions per was much lower than if we'd opened up for a more simple anthology. In the latter case, you'll have to do some blocking with different stories to see how the whole publication will look in the end.

*The choice is made, now it's time to send emails.* Come up with two basic templates: one for acceptances and one for rejections. In each case, be polite and kind, but firm. You don't need to apologize for not accepting a story, nor do you need to fawn over accepted writers. You are, after all, interacting as a business, however informal that business may be.

In both cases, try to provide some additional feedback as to what works and what doesn't. Talk about a few strong points of the story and what you liked, then discuss some stuff that could be better --- in the case of accepted stories, this will be stuff that will show up in edits, whereas in the case of rejected stories, this will be stuff that the author could use when reworking their story.

*From there, it's on to editing the individual stories.* (communicate with authors)

We've got our stories, they've been edited, now what? Why, it's off to the layout and design fairies!

We've got stuff in a basic layout with some design decisions made. What about the author, though? Now's a good time to show them a sample: their work in the final layout. (why)
