\f0\fs28 \cf0 Like a flame burning through celluloid film, the third curtain had signified a drastic change, slow enough to be observed and yet faster than ey could possibly hope to avoid.  The few tenuous touches on reality that held RJ into eir seat in the tech booth scorched and peeled away, and the pain spiked.\
RJ lay on a tile floor, dirty and yellow.\
The tiles were completely regular, one foot on a side, and obviously made of some synthetic material.  They were simply glued to a concrete foundation with no grout, each tile butting up against the others to form a grid of thin, black lines, showing where the dirt of hundreds of feet had been ground into the remaining seams.\
Ey couldn't move yet, but ey could still see that the world was bounded.  There was a thin plastic strip of molding around the edge of a wall, and then regular rectangles of blue, a wall.}
