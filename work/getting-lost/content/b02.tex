RJ slowly picked emself up off of the floor, staggering to eir feet in the middle of a long row of lockers.  Ey hardly felt weak, but the shock to the system of being in the tech booth and theater sim, and then suddenly being back in high school was taking its toll on eir wits.

Ey swiped eir paw from left to right in front of emself to bring up the menu.  Only, no menu came up.  There was nothing in this sim, wherever it was.  Ey had no ACLs, and there was no global menu.

Beginning to panic, RJ felt behind emself, reaching for that sense of reality outside of the sim that should be at his back.  It was there, ey could feel it like a cool breath of air on the back of his neck, but there was something keeping em from being able to get to it.  A thin barrier, a membrane, like a sheet of plastic that kept him trapped within the sim.

And then, with a jolt of pain through the back of eir neck and down along eir spine, it was gone.

Throughout all of the practice runs and training on the workstation that had gone into eir education, that feeling had only come up a small handful of times before.  It was the feeling of being forcibly disconnected from the workstation through the manual expedient of removing the contacts from the cradles in which they rested.  It was the shock of being brought to reality from out of a sim with no disconnection.

And with that, RJ should've found emself back in the tech booth, trying to figure out what strange loop the theater had gotten itself into to freeze eir workstation.  The lockers never wavered, though, and now ey found emself stuck in eir old school with no contact to the world outside of the sim, or whatever this\ldots{}place was.
