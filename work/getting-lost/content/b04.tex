It took AwDae just under two hours to find the microphone.

The first hour was spent searching the auditorium thoroughly.  Ey searched by walking around clapping and humming, then singing songs half-remembered from productions ey had helped with in the past.  Ey would've whistled if it wasn't for the structure of a canid muzzle.  There was no way eir lips would manage to pull that off.

Silence.

After an hour, venturing even into the overhead areas where sound wouldn't reach, ey gave up and took a break.

Taking the slip of paper with Cicero's transactions from eir pocket once more, ey scanned over the titles of the initiatives voted on.  There was very little there to latch onto.  Or, rather, there was way too much.  AwDae couldn't manage to even boil down the table into any single sentence, much less something useful.  The cat had apparently voted on just about everything, without taking any breaks.

Eventually, when the rows started to blur into one another, ey levered emself up from the auditorium seat ey had chosen.  Ey refolded the paper and slipped it back into the pocket before checking on the board once more.  Everything remained set as it was before the break.

Venturing outside the auditorium, AwDae had imagined ey would work in concentric circle away from the auditorium.  This turned out not to be the best idea.  The theater was nestled between two arms of the school which did not meet.  That made their routine fairly artuous.  Ey'd walk down one hallway, poke into classrooms, and make noise before moving on.  When ey reached the end of eir circle, ey had to jog around the auditorium through the student center to go down the other hallway and do the same

Eventually ey gave up on the concentric circle plan and started working from north to south.   Ey worked through the entirety of one hallway, clapping and hollering, without hearing anything, before moving on to the area of the student center near the auditorium.

It was there that ey heard the first, faint hum.

At first, it had skimmed beneath eir attention, sounding rather like an echo from eir own voice in the cavernous space of the student center.  When the open doors to the aduditorium caught eir eyes, ey tried once more, getting another faint hum that slowly died out as the space and air dissipated the tone.

It took another few minutes to find the microphone itself: a small bit of hardware resting delicately atop the door handle leading into the principal's office just to the northeast of the auditorium doors.  It was surprising, in a way, that ey hadn't managed to trigger any feedback earlier, until ey realized eir mistake: ey would have to shout loud enough to be heard in the auditorium; without the speakers producing noise loud enough to make it back through the walls and reach the mic, there would be no feedback.

The door was labeled `Admin.', which was omminous.  Although there was a head office at the front of the school, administration was where the principal and vice principals' offices were.  It was one of those places that lingered in the mind of every student who had passed through the doors of the school.  Getting called to the front office was usually bad enough -- a call from a parent!? -- but getting called to the admin office was worse still.

AwDae delicately picked up the microphone through mounting feedback before shutting it off, eir ears laid flat in an attempt to shut off the growing hum from the auditorium.  The sound stopped a scant few moments after the mic was shut off, bouncing around the auditorium and the student center.
