st The following is from an incomplete NaNoWriMo project I keep meaning to pick back up again and comes with three disclaimers: 1) it's very old writing, so it's a bit embarrassing to share; 2) as it's incomplete, it's also largely unedited; and 3) it features a gender-neutral character using Spivak pronouns (ey/em/eir), so fair warning on that. As mentioned, this is about furry-as-subculture rather than necessarily about anthro animals.
