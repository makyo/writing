title: Haha, well...whoops!
---

Kind of accidentally told a whole bunch of people.  I seem to go through this honesty streak every now and then, and it's been hitting really hard recently.  Two AMAs on Reddit, sharing a few other things with people, and now this...

> Makyo buries its head in pillows so that the rest of it twitches instead because god damnit can't even type >:/
> 
> Polaroid looks up at TIGR, too! He just happens to be standing right in front of him. ;3
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Hey Makyo, now this is just completely ‘out there', but is this like a nervous energy kinda thing?"
> 
> You yerf, "Nervous tic, but definitely a full-blown tic. Something is misfiring as a result of an inappropriate physical reaction to anxiety."
> 
> Makyo, fingers crossed, used to have excruciating acid reflux, which faded right as this began.
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "OK, so here is where it gets ‘out there'. Nervous requires energy....if one was to wear oneself out, so to speak...."
> 
> Duelist eh, "You know."
> 
> Sturgis arrives from the foyer.
> 
> Sturgis grunts.
> 
> Puc deidles with a grunt.
> 
> JanusFox yips, "What Duelist is saying is that you should have lots of sex with him."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Well, anything strenuous >;)"
> 
> Makyo giggles and noses Duelist, "Wearing myself out helps, though I'm going to go with running and walking. Libido is currently hovering between 0-5%. There's a chance that that is a factor, but I would've expected presentation when libido hit that point a few months back."
> 
> You yerf, "But yes, exercise helps, but a lot of it is due to getting in a flow state while running."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Yeah, it sounds like your hormones are out of whack...."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "And that is an uneducated ‘opinion'"
> 
> JanusFox has whormones.
> 
> You yerf, "Yes, they are. Testosterone is basically at 0."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Have you considered test therapy?"
> 
> Polaroid pounces JanusFox's whoremones.
> 
> JanusFox acks and spills them all over the floor.
> 
> You yerf, "I'm currently on medroxyprogesterone acetate and cyproterone acetate to maintain that 0 state, actually. Therapy would be simply...stopping. That's scheduled for december. If this lasts past September, I will stop early :o)"
> 
> Duelist ohs...
> 
> Makyo a bit of a messed up fox :/
> 
> Duelist scritches his head.
> 
> Makyo: chemically castrated. AMA? :oP
> 
> Polaroid scratches his head. "According to the AMA, yes."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Ohhhhhhh."
> 
> Polaroid yips, "In males, MPA has been used to control inappropriate sexual behavior to chemically castrate convicted sex offenders.\[10\]"
> 
> Duelist hms. AMA, eh?
> 
> You yerf, "Sure."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "What's up with that?"
> 
> Kawper goes home.
> 
> Kawper has left.
> 
> JanusFox is just o.o
> 
> You yerf, "There are three primary reasons. First: JD and I are in it together, because it's something JD has done before and I always dismissed. Second: it's one of those slightly self-destructive things that I like to write about. Third: it was a test to see if all of the problems I had with gender just had to do with being a sexual person."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Well...."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Hormones are weird things."
> 
> You yerf, "True ^^"
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Affect different people in different ways."
> 
> Makyo apologizes. Is for oversharing, apparently :/
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "I dunno, doesn't seem like anything to apologize for."
> 
> Polaroid shrugs. Singe coils into a ball.
> 
> FoxLord scoots. gunna lay down
> 
> FoxLord has disconnected.
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Is there any correlation between lack of test and your anxiety?"
> 
> Duelist knows low test can cause pretty fierce anxiety
> 
> JanusFox yips, "So can high test."
> 
> You yerf, "It's possible, for sure. But to be honest, the mental and emotional perception of anxiety is no different now than before I started clonazepam in February. If it has increased my presentation in the physical arena, then I will stop come october if this presentation isn't gone."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "If/when you stop, I will be very curious as to your rebound."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Cuz I imagine you're gonna be a beast for a few weeks! >;)"
> 
> Polaroid chuckles n grins.
> 
> MegaWolf nose Makyo
> 
> You yerf, "Definitely! Particularly as hormones tend to rebound and oscillate, rather than have a smooth gradient to the new level. I went straight to zero for a while, then up to, say, 10%, and have leveled out to a point where I can look at porn and say, "That's hot", and still remain basically neutral."
> 
> Polaroid tickle MegaWolf parts.
> 
> Zhorah would like to be nonsexual :/
> 
> MegaWolf yip
> 
> Makyo noselick Megawoof.
> 
> Polaroid doesn't mind his sexuality.
> 
> JanusFox would get so much more done without porn.
> 
> MegaWolf growls softly, "Everyone I know in real life seems to think I'm completely asexual"
> 
> MegaWolf growls softly, "It amuses me to no end."
> 
> Makyo nod at Zhorah.
> 
> Polaroid yips, "Because they don't know you here. :3″
> 
> Duelist has high test. Walking hornball. 40 years old, feelin' like a teenager.
> 
> Zhorah wouldn't mind not having to think about never getting ay
> 
> MegaWolf growls softly, "A lot of people I know here think the same thing"
> 
> You yerf, "It's a little illegal, but oh well, what Man would go about and do this to themselves?"
> 
> Duelist wells, 39.
> 
> Polaroid yips, "You do a pretty good job of seeming to keep it in check, D. :3″
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Is it illegal?"
> 
> MegaWolf growls softly, "TIGR Stud"
> 
> You yerf, "I order the Depo Provera from New Zealand and the Androcur from somewhere in China"
> 
> Polaroid yips, "Either that or I'm not trying enough!"
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "As crude as this may sound, I was under the impression taht anything that made one less masculine was ok and anything that mad you more masculine was jailable."
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "At least in this country."
> 
> MegaWolf growls softly, "Well as long as you're not going on the Tour de Frencholes."
> 
> Somewhere on the muck, Floid has disconnected.
> 
> MegaWolf paw Polaroid, squeeze Makyo
> 
> Polaroid growl softly. :>
> 
> You yerf, "It is controlled, mostly because I can get the depo for $6 a shot instead of $200 a shot :oP"
> 
> MegaWolf oddly dizzy and lightheaded for some reason. Hmm.
> 
> Duelist growls quietly, "Or course, now all the 60+ year olds are popping viagra and smearing andro-gel all over themselves in a desperate attempt to stop aging...."
