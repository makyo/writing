This is really cool!

I can understand some concerns that people might have regarding the list, and I do think it's a good thing for the creators to include a list of concerns and responses at the beginning of the document itself.  They do a good job of addressing them as well as summing up a lot of the reasons why I like seeing such a document put out there.  The list provides good examples not only of all the work being done with gender and trans\* issues, but also just the sheer diversity of those involved and their stories.  It's as if We Happy Trans and This Is H.O.W. went ahead and published a list of role models, in a way, and one varied enough to give just about everyone someone of interest to look up to.

If you check it out, make sure to download the list itself (link at the top of the page) and read through at least some of the biography snippets.
