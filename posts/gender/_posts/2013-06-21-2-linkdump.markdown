More and more links, less and less bandwidth.  Most of that is because I'm
writing in earnest about other things again, and that feels really good!  The
downside is that I just can't bring myself to write a thousand words about some
thousand-word article I found anymore.  I do still find all of this stuff
interesting, though, so I'll pass it on.

### Games

This is a category that I fear will never be empty!  Hooray!  Go games!

You really did it.

For serious, though, there's been a steady stream of news coming in on the
gaming front with regards to gender and sexuality, and I am happy to say that
the tide is turning toward the positive, however slowly.  I only started really
reading about this sort of stuff maybe a year ago and I still don't really play
any games, but still, I like to watch!

### SFWA

The SFWA recently went through a kerfuffle regarding their newsletter featuring
a boys-club-esque article written by a couple of old white dudes.  It's worth
collecting a few links if only for the first, which brings up good points that
stand even outside of the subculture of SF/F writers.

  reasons.

  went through which some saw as promoting objectification of women.

* [Polyamory in the News: Poly as "the relationship status of a totally fabulous
  future][10] - Partner pointed this out to me as a very "me" sort of article.
  I think he's right.  The big take-away is communication and how that gets
  skipped in a lot of instances.
* [Coverflip: Maureen Johnson Calls For An End To Gendered Book Covers With An
  Amazing Challenge ][15] - A delightful way of pointing out gendered visual
  language on book covers.

  language.
