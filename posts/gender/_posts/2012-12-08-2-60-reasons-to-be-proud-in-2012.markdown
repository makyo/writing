The single trans\* item out of sixty aside (which, as I've posted already, is very much debatable), I find it interesting that just about all of these items are about visibility and new norms.  It is important, especially for LGBT youth, to have positive role models in the public, and I appreciate that it's not really newsworthy for someone to come out anymore, but just an article full of "hey this celeb is gay and so is that one and so is that one and that one even has gay friends" is kinda strange.  Ah well, I don't mean to rain on the parade - there's a lot of good things, to be sure - it's just a BuzzFeed article, and it is fairly positive :o)
