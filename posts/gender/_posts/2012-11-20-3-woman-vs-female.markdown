The difference between 'woman' and 'female'.  In a nutshell, the former's a noun, and the latter's an adjective.  It's...very strange to me, that, in some places (coughfurrycough), it seems to be the norm to call women 'females'.  To be fair, men are often referred to as males, but I don't really know that that makes it better.  It feels like being referred to as cattle.

And foxes are not cattle &gt;:/
