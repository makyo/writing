This made me giggle a little.  The idea of it, to be sure, but also the execution, though it sounds like some folks aren't quite so happy.  The quote calling it "terrorist acts against children" was a bit of an eye-roller.  Additionally, I do agree that it's not going to...necessarily do a whole lot.  I mean. three hundred toys out of the entirety of all toys, all things that children see, all over the United States is going to be a curiosity, rather than any successful subversion of gender roles that will get people thinking.  Still, neat idea :3

Thanks to @SatoriTindalos for the tip.
