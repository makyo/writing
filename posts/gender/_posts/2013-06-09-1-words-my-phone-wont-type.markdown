title: Words Android Refuses to Type
---

I keep running across words that are disallowed by autocorrect on Android
4.2.2 using swiping on Android Keyboard (AOSP).  They're not censored, as
you can type them by hand, but they will never autocorrect.  I'm not really
sure of the reason, perhaps it has to do with trying to prevent users from
autocorrecting themselves into trouble?  Some of them are pretty out there,
though, and honestly, there has to be better UX around that (say, having a
list of words that never autocorrects to that word *by default*, but is still
on the list of selectable words).

## Curse words

Pretty standard list of dirty words (their variants are usually blocked, too).

* fuck
* shit
* cunt
* ass
* butt
* piss
* cock
* tits

## Non curse words

This is where it gets a little weird.  I suppose I can understand not wanting to
accidentally text 'penis' to a family member, but  some of these are a
little...out there.

* suck
* sex
* sexuality
* penis
* vagina
* clitoris
* menstrual
* menstruation
* erection
* semen
* coitus
* anal
* rape (â€½)
* orgasm
* circumcised
* nipple
* vibrator
* rectum
* genitalia

## Words Android will type

These are some words Android will type that are a little weird given the
above list.

* asexuality
* prepuce
* cervix
* vulva
* foreskin
* womb
* prostate
* oral
* condom
* pussy

It all kind of makes me wonder what goes into making these blacklists of words.
What was going through the mind of someone who decided that 'rape' was never a
word that someone should want to type when swiping?  What about 'menstrual'?
And 'coitus'?  I can't even remember the last time I used that for anything
other than discussing "the standard post-coitus cigarette", and then only as a
joke.  Sigh.
