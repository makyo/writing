Whoops! I accidentally stayed up way too late fleshing out a bunch of poems from [Missives](/fiction/missives), plus two more drafts! Oh well. Sleep is cheap, I guess. Anyway, there's a whole bunch of new poems and stuff in [the poetry section](/poetry). Since I'm an incurable dork, this includes a PDF of collected works generated from the individual poems themselves.

The new poems include:

* [Cycle](/poetry/cycle)
* [Meaning &amp; Self](/poetry/meaning-and-self)
* From *Missives* in story order:
    * [Though the flow'r may bloom ere long](/poetry/though-the-flowr-may-bloom-ere-long)
    * [Delay, then, the morn](/poetry/delay-then-the-morn)
    * [Thy gift](/poetry/thy-gift)
    * [You find me at a disadvantage](/poetry/you-find-me-at-a-disadvantage)
    * [A rose, single, now blooming](/poetry/a-rose-single-now-blooming)
