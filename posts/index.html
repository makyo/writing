<p>One of the best ways to internalize something important, I've always felt, is to write about it.  If ever there's something that weighs on me, something that means a lot to me for no clear reason, or something that I just don't quite understand, I've always had good luck with writing about it.</p>

<p>This site is for that. It allows me to explore through writing all of those things that interest me as mentioned.  The format is longer than a blog, allowing what I write to stand on its own.  If ever, for some reason, you wish to contact me about any of this, feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:makyo@drab-makyo.com">makyo@drab-makyo.com</a>.</p>
