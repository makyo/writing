title: Furry Writers' Guild Presidential Candidacy
---

Back in 2015, when I joined the [Furry Writers' Guild](https://furrywritersguild.com), I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into. [adjective][species] was chugging along, which felt good, and I was only then starting to get into furry fiction. I'd been writing loads of non-fiction for years, of course, but finding a few stories I had to tell started pushing me into wider realms.

When I joined the Guild, it was as an associate member. My work with [a][s] saw to that, as well as my few articles and a story or two posted elsewhere. It felt like a comfortable spot to me, and I found myself surrounded almost instantly by wonderful folks and neat ideas.

In my time with the Guild, I like to think that I've grown in a lot of ways. For one, I've become more and more entranced with furry fiction, and my few stories spawned [several](http://post-self.io)[^postself] [fiction](http://exocortic.es)[^exocortices] [projects](/anthologies/arcana)[^arcana] of my own.

I've also become more adept at providing feedback to others on their own writing. This had always been a thing with [a][s], of course, but the ability to sit down with a piece of writing and provide feedback along several axes has grown from "email with a few comments" to "fully marked up document while editing an anthology".  It's a place I'd never have pictured myself five years ago!

Now, I want to do my best to give back to the FWG what I can. I feel that I can offer my services, not only as a writer, but as an organizer. I've worked through several capacities and positions of leadership over the years, and each has given me experience that has extended beyond just my duties in that position.

I'd like to formally announce my candidacy for president of the Furry Writers' Guild. I hope only that I can offer the Guild my service in return for all that it has given me!

In a future post, I'll explain some of the things I'd like to accomplish (or at least address) with such a platform.
