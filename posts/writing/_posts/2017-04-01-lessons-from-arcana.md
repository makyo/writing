title: Lessons from <em>Arcana</em>
---

At the end of 2016, I decided to take on [*Arcana*](/anthologies/arcana) as a project. I'd been thinking for a while that writing and editing were something I'd like to do more seriously. Like, I'd done the software thing for a while, and it treated me well; maybe now it was time to see what I could do with my love of words and stories.

*Arcana* is an anthology of stories using the archetypes embodied by the major arcana of the standard Tarot deck. All of the cards in the deck have meaning behind them, but the majors are the ones most commonly known --- Death, The Lovers, The Hanged Man, The Tower, and so on --- and the ones that best lend themselves to a writing prompt, in my opinion. An anthology of short stories felt natural to me: twenty-two cards, twenty-two stories. Each would have their own archetype backing it and their own arc, and there would be the arc inherent in the majors to guide the anthology itself.

It was an ambitious project. Probably too ambitious for a first anthology, if I'm honest. But there I was, writing up a call, and Jonathan Thurston over at [Thurston Howl Publications](https://www.thurstonhowlpublications.com/) liked the idea and was willing to publish the result. All of my editing to date had been with [\[adjective\]\[species\]](http://adjectivespecies.com), which was 99% non-fiction, and here I was stepping up to edit a fiction anthology from start to finish.

The call ended yesterday, having been open in some form or another since early December, and if working in tech has taught me anything, it's that now is a good time for a retrospective.

### What we were up against

With a lot of anthologies, you pick a theme and some restrictions, and open for submissions. Your theme may be, to borrow from ROAR, "paradise", your restrictions may be explicit, such as "G-PG13 rating" or "15,000 word max" or implicit, such as "I want to keep the anthology around 100,000 words total". You open for submissions for a while, close, slush, announce, edit, publish, etc.

With *Arcana*, though, we were essentially opening twenty-two calls for submissions. We need one story per card, and we'd like to have more than one to choose from. It's a strange anthology in that sense. We had to find a good story that fit the archetypes of the card, as we would with a normal single call for submissions, but we also had to make sure that that story would fit within the flow of the anthology as a whole. It's all sorts of complicated.

Luckily Thurston had some ideas as to how to attack this. He'd been working on his anthology *The Seven Deadly Sins*, which had a similar problem. He needed enough submissions for each of the sins to make pulling together the anthology worthwhile. With that knowledge and some stumbling about, we came up with a plan and opened the call.

### What we did

We tried to tackle these problems in three different ways.

#### Invitations

Our first step was to pick half of the cards and make them invitation only. That is, we wouldn't take any submissions for them, we'd just ask authors whom we knew would be game and whom we trusted to write for these cards.

* 0 --- The Fool
* II --- The High Priestess
* III --- The Empress
* IV --- The Emperor
* X --- The Wheel of Fortune
* XI --- Justice
* XII --- The Hanged Man
* XVII --- The Star
* XVIII --- The Moon
* XIX --- The Sun
* XXI --- The World

We deliberately chose cards from throughout the majors so that there would be a balance of invite and submission cards. We also made sure to choose some cards that we worried wouldn't get many submissions anyway. The Star, The Moon, and The Sun in particular are more subtle than at first glance, so those were made invite only. Also, The Fool and The World as well as The Wheel of Fortune were chosen as good anchors throughout the anthology.

From there, we hunted down authors. For some, we had a specific card in mind, while for others, we simply showed them the list and let them choose.
