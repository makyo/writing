This was JD's birthday dinner for 2013, and it went over very well.  This is based loosely off our standard stroganoff recipe, except that it uses heavy cream and brandy instead of sour cream and wine.  This is a pretty standard mushroom cream sauce, but we spiced it up with truffle oil and spicy italian sausage.

### Ingredients

* 8-12 oz mushrooms, preferably two kinds (I used maitake and shiitake)
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 1+ cups heavy cream
* 1+ tbsp rubbed sage
* 2-3 cloves crushed garlic
* crushed black pepper
* salt
* splash brandy or white/rose wine
* dash of truffle oil (optional)
* 2 Italian sausage links (optional)

### Preparation

1. (Skip to step 3 if not using sausage)  Slice sausage and fry until cooked in a skillet over medium heat.
2. Remove the sausage, but leave the grease in the skillet.
3. Sautee onions in the pan with the butter and, if using, the sausage grease until translucent.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms and sautee until reduced to about half size.
5. Add the truffle oil (if using), sage, black pepper, and garlic and stir for about two minutes.
6. Turn the heat to low and add the cream.
7. After a few minutes, salt to taste and add a splash of brandy or white/rose wine
8. Simmer on low for five to ten more minutes until pasta is ready.

Serve over cavatappi or similar pasta with something bright enough to cut through a rich sauce.  A not-so-oaky white like Pinot Grigio or Riesling, or a fruity red like Beaujolais nouveau, or a fruity Belgian or American beer.
