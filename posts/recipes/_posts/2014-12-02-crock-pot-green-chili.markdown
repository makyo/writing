title: Easy Crockpot Green Chili
layout: post

---

I've posted the [recipe](/posts/recipes/2013/06/09/green-chili/) for an
oven-based green chili stew before, but I don't often have the time or energy
required to do a slow roast in the oven of an entire pork shoulder.  What I
usually make instead is a crock-pot version.  It's faster, easier, and still
pretty tasty, all things considered!

### Ingredients

* 4 4-oz cans of diced green chiles
* 3-4 cups water (less water equals more chile flavor)
* &frac12;-1 lbs cubed pork (usually sold as such in the supermarket)
* 1 medium to large onion, diced
* 2 potatoes, peeled and diced
* 2 chipotles in adobo sauce, diced
* 1 tbsp adobo sauce from chiles
* 1 tbsp chile caribe
* 1 tbsp chicken or vegetable Better-Than-Bouillion or one cube veggie bouillion
  (such as [this](http://www.knorr.com/product/detail/246069/vegetable))
* Optional additional veggies such as zucchini, carrots, etc.

### Preparation

Toss everything in a crock-pot, set to high, and cook until pork is tender.
Really, that's it!  I usually start this over lunch and have it ready for
dinner.  It goes well in burritos, on its own, thickened with flour and used to
smother other dishes, and so on.
