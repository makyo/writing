I'm traveling on my and JD's anniversary, so the night before, I decided to make a rather nice meal out of the short ribs he had picked out.  Again, this isn't anything in particular, though it uses quite a bit of Asian flavors from various countries.  Even so, it's "international" enough to serve with a loaf of fresh-baked (well, take-and-bake) bread without things seeming out of place, but I'd imagine it would be just as good with sides of rice and kimchi.

## Short Ribs

* Six beef short ribs (about 2.5 lbs)
* 1 cup red wine
* 1 cup water
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1/2 cup Korean chili powder
* 2 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp five-spice powder
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1/4 onion - grated
* 1/4 onion - diced
* 1 tsp salt
* pepper

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
2. Mix the chili powder, five-spice powder, honey, garlic, grated onion, salt, and pepper together in a bowl with your fingers.
3. Start saut&eacute;eing the diced onions in oil in a heavy pot or dutch oven.
4. Rub the short ribs with the chili powder mix evenly on all sides.
5. Brown the short ribs in the pan with the onions briefly on all sides.
6. Add the wine, water, sesame oil, soy sauce, and brown sugar and cover, moving the pot to the oven.  Braise for two hours at 350&deg;F, then reduce the heat to 325&deg;F and hold for an additional half hour.
7. Serve when cooled slightly.  The boiled down braising liquid, about the consistency of jam for us, was delicious on bread.

## Broccoli

* 1 head broccoli
* 1 tbsp black sesame seeds
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* Canola oil

1. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium-high heat until fragrant.
2. Add the broccoli and stir, keeping the broccoli from sticking to the dry pan.
3. After the broccoli has started to turn bright green and wilt a little, add the canola oil and stir briefly, then add the soy sauce and rice vinegar.
4. Cook for another five to ten minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated and the broccoli has cooked down a little further - it should still be quite crisp.
