When RJ gets Lost in the 'net, stuck without a way to return to the world outside, ey finds emself torn between accepting eir fate and the struggle to escape.  Meanwhile, Dr. Carter Ramirez, a specialist in the Lost, finds herself meeting with a surprising amount of political pressure when attending to RJ's case.  Much more is bound up in the case of the Lost than appears at first glance.

New chapters weekly (I hope)!
