title: An Argument for Non-Conformity

---

Okay, so the title is a bit grandiose.  

I want to address some of the ideas that JM's [previous article][1] brought up
for me.  It's a magnificent read about the ways in which the mainstream can
benefit those who participate, touching on privilege, presentation, and what we
do in private.  JM and I seem to come to a firm agreement that his articles are
the more immediately applicable, whereas I'm busy navel-gazing; furry does not
occur in a vacuum, though, so perhaps I ought to talk some more about the wider
social implications of furry.  

As with anything that can be simply negated by adding 'non-' or 'ab-' (you know,
like [Abby-Normal][2]), there are two sides to the coin, and more often than
not, the interaction between the two is hardly a simple binary, often involving
friction, and sometimes quite a lot at that. 

As many readers can attest, there has been a wave of "be yourself" propaganda
pushed on children and young adults in America over the last thirty or so years,
appeals to the sense of non-conformity that each of us carries within us to some
extent.  Much of this, of course, was awful, saccharine filler that served no
purpose other than to make someone money, and blanket non-conformity is hardly
something I'd advise someone to undertake.  However, just as in the rest of the
world, furry has something to benefit from careful application of
non-conformity.<!--more-->

Non-conformity and subculture have mixed for a long, long time.  Anyone who has
been part of the goth scene, or the punk scene before it, or the rock scene
before that, or the jazz scene before that, knows this.  These are, of course,
examples that take the idea of non-conformity and spread it throughout the very
interest that brings them together, turning it into something of a fandom
itself.  Even beyond the idea of fandom, though, non-conformity and its close
cousin, transgression (an act that goes beyond generally accepted boundaries),
have served groups within society as long as there has been society; one need
only look to the history of early Christianity to see that.  Non-conformity and
transgression are hardly artifacts of modern western society.

There are, in fact, a lot of things about furry that can be seen as
transgressive, both within and outside of the fandom.  Some minor
transgressions, acts that take place outside accepted boundaries, are seen as
core ore close to our subculture in many instances: street-fursuiting, a
propensity for collecting stuffed animals, or even hanging tasteful furry art in
the home or office ([these][3] [two][4] pieces grace our walls right in the
entryway, along with a ton of pictures of our dogs) are just a few ways in which
we can step into furry space in a non-furry context, even if only a little bit.
Minor transgressions, to be sure, but it's easy to see the roots of
transgressive behavior within our fandom.  What could be more non-conforming
than not conforming to the generally accepted species, after all?

This is, I believe, part of the reason for the relatively accepting nature of
furry as well.  A group which is, in a way, transgressive at its core is often a
safe space for those with a stake in otherwise transgressive behavior.  This is
more than just "falling in with a bad crowd" - after all, we're not *that* bad,
are we?  Rather, this goes along with the idea of finding a safe space for
oneself.  A safe space is, in some ways, a space in which one can engage in
either transgressive behavior or discuss, think about, or otherwise wax
metatextual without fear or repercussion, or at least in the hopes that that's
the case.  This is the purpose of the [safe-space][5] signs in schools, which
serve this purpose in a subtler way, after all: in a place where acknowledging
LGBT issues positively might be seen as a transgression, or at least a form of
non-conformity, these signs show that the educator is attempting to create a
place free of that association.

When it comes down to it, the ideas of non-conformity and transgression serve an
important role to minority identities.  As [this][6] article bluntly puts it:

> Queerness is not just about whom or how you fuck. It is also about not being
part of that mainstream culture, about being decidedly against that mainstream
culture. It is about disruption. It is about putting things at risk.

Of course, both that quote and my own words are incautious: minority identity,
and in this example, queerness, are generalizations used to described trends in
identity shared within a social group.  I know there are several individuals who
would disagree.  I have my own hesitancy, here.  There is an uncomfortable stage
for some in the reclamation of a word where it still carries some of its old
connotation before the new one has gained general acceptance.  "Queer" is in
that space for me, because it still has its connotation of "weirdness", it still
denotes transgression.  I'll hasten to add, though, that this is an ongoing
process, within myself even as it is within society at large.  The word
"straight", after all, has been largely accepted to simply imply
heterosexuality, despite its prior connotations of "going straight", where
homosexuality was seen as crooked or deviant (which has been notably lamp-shaded
by the movie [Bent][7]).

However, I think that the word "queer", and others like it, are important in the
sense that this sort of non-conformity is vital to identity.  When it comes to
arguing identity (that is, discussing the point with the goal of changing minds,
not necessarily having shouting arguments - though sometimes that too), it is
advantageous for the argument to be cast in one's own terms.  When the argument
from a minority is cast in the terms of the majority, the minority often only
receives relatively small concessions, rather than recognition.  Transgressive
language and non-conformity help to recast the argument so that there is a
greater likelihood of one's point being made forcefully.\*

While conformity is generally the province of the majority, non-conformity is
hardly detrimental to it.  The culture of the majority is a static behemoth,
whose only purpose is to remain precisely where it is, as it is.  This is all
well and good for those within the culture who benefit from that stasis, but
this isn't the case for everyone, and often isn't even the case for the actual
by-the-numbers majority of individuals wrapped up in society.  Minority culture
and identity, subversive and transgressive, have the job of pushing the majority
culture forward in such a way as to improve life for more and more of those in
society, attempting to break that stasis to benefit those involved with their
culture and identity.  A lot of social progress that humanity can claim comes
from this tension and friction; the majority promises safety, the minority
promises progress.  Both have a purpose.

So, let's tie this back to furry and the idea of conformity.

When it comes to JM's article, I really must stress that I whole-heartedly agree
with it.  There is a lot to be gained in terms of safety by conforming to the
majority.  One furthers one's standing within that culture by not, say, wearing
a collar to one's interview.  This helps in terms of personal progress: a better
job, perhaps a greater amount of respect from those around you, and yes, even
the possibility of using that progress towards one's goals within the fandom
(EF2015 sounds like a good idea - JD's been talking about it for a while now).

Non-conformity is nothing to feel bad about, however.  Neither is conformity!
Both have their purpose in our lives, and every single one of us expresses both
in some way or another at different times and in different aspects of our social
interaction for our own reasons.  Even furry.  Transgressive acts such as
street-fursuiting, publicly visible gatherings such as conventions, and even
talking about furry from a critical theory standpoint on a publicly visible
website have helped to legitimize furry as an identity, a membership, a
subculture.  Conformity, on the other hand, helps many the individual members of
furry to keep things moving forward by benefiting from what the majority has to
offer to those who go along with it.

\* Note that this is a very reductive view on critical- and queer-theory, topics
very much worthy of their own post(s).  I have to get to the point somehow,
though!  If this sort of thing is interesting to you, I highly suggest prowling
around more: there's a ton out there.
