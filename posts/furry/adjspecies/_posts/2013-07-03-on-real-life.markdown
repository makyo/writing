title: On "Real Life"

---

One of my classmates in college was pursuing what I believe was a double major
in engineering and music composition.  He was a pretty great guy, at his most
helpful when it came to the discussions on sound and acoustics.  He was also a
huge nerd, but so were we all: we were the first class to help get the
composition department at the university up and running, so we were the ones
actually pushing to get the degree program started - my nerdiness took the form
of running the composition lab.

For his junior recital, one of the two we were required to give consisting
entirely of pieces we composed, he performed an extended three-movement piece
for solo French Horn titled "Journey To Arelle".  It's one of those titles you
have to say out loud to get the joke.  The song was a tone poem about what
mental processes a character left to idle on Word of Warcraft must go through
when their player went off to "deal with RL".

The idea of RL - "Real Life" - in opposition to things furry is, I think, an
interesting and telling one.  There's a lot to be said for immersion when it
comes to gaming, for sure, but many furries apply it to much more than just an
experience that can be had sitting at a console.  We're hardly the only ones, of
course, but it helps in understanding just how the fandom works to know that it
occurs in a context that is not always "real life."<!--more-->

Role-play in and of itself is usually set as an opposite to real life. The idea
of something in opposition to structured activities such as role-play is not a
new one;  this is easily seen in the previous example, of course.  One is
spending the time and effort to pretend to be this character within the set
bounds of the game, computer or otherwise, in which that character ultimately
resides.  There is a literal role to play of some other living (or perhaps
undead) being, here, and to attend to daily tasks that may be wildly out of
character if not outright out of period is certainly returning to "real life".
There just isn't the connection tying the two lives together, there.

The difference between a strict role-playing type scenario and furry, however,
is that furry has no rules, no objectives, and no canon.  This isn't to say that
it can't, of course, as plenty of folk I know within the fandom play
furry-themed RPGs such as Ironclaw or Usagi Yojimbo, or even appropriate
not-strictly-furry games to their own uses, creating new species to be used in,
say, Star Wars themed pencil-and-paper role-playing games.

Furry lacks a central story, though: there's no canon to guide us other than the
shared interest that ties us together.  In our case, though we often play the
roles of our created or chosen characters in various ways, from interacting with
them in text-only chat rooms and MU\*s to commissioning artwork or dressing up
in giant animal bags at conventions, we don't have rules or story to separate
out a perfectly livable daily life as an animal person from a perfectly livable
daily life as someone pretending to be an animal person.

I think this shows that furry is something beyond just role-play: it's a whole
separate context, a separate life lived in opposition to what a lot of people
still think of as "normal".  We incorporate role-play as a tool rather than as
some sole form of interaction.  We live our lives out as furries here and there,
but for the large part, much of our interaction within the fandom remains a form
of escapism.  Beyond that, however, furry as a subculture is still seen by many
both inside and outside the fandom as an interest that's bizarre at best,
downright abnormal at worst.

This isn't an opinion held by just those outside, as I've said.  The fact that
we maintain such a strict separation of concerns when it comes to our shared
affinity for anthropomorphized animals and day-to-day interaction with those who
don't share our interest shows our own willingness to accept what we consider a
normal life alongside the lives we lead within our chosen subculture.  It's
willful and, as JM and I both point out, hardly negative and not without
utility.  A sense of normalcy pays off just as much as all that we gain by
virtue of this transgressive subculture.

This isn't the type of thing that furry is alone in creating.  There are other
hobbies and lifestyles - especially the latter - which readily fit into a
separate context from everyday life.  These are the types of things where one
might find oneself being reminded, "don't cross the streams".  The further
something is from being regarded as a part of the main-stream (you'll forgive
the mixed metaphor, here), the more likely it is to be seen as constructive when
one prevents it from overlapping with day-to-day life.  Philately, while
definitely a bookish and stereotypically nerdy sort of hobby, is something one
might freely talk about with friends and coworkers outside the stamp-collecting
subculture.  One's collection of firearms or bedroom proclivities rarely mix
well in so-called polite company without also being some sort of transgression.

This holds especially true for lifestyles.  In recent years, even in this last
year, being lesbian, gay, or bisexual has hardly entailed the same amount of
hiding a core part of oneself at work and with friends, separating out a portion
of life from what's considered normal by society at large.  This wasn't always
the case, though, and it's humbling to look back, as someone who grew up fitting
more or less solidly into one of those categories, and see how differently the
world works today in terms of "crossing the streams".  

The interesting thing to consider with this analogy is the level of choice
involved in furry as compared to sexual orientation.  I used the term
"lifestyles" intentionally above, though it's fallen out of favor when referring
to one's orientation, because of the fact that there exists a significant
portion of the furry world that lives furry, identifies as furry, and feels that
they don't necessarily have a choice about doing so, much in the same way that
many live gay, identify as gay, and feel they don't have a choice in the matter.
One can look at a hobby from the outside and see it as something that someone
chooses to do and generally be correct about that, but not always.  For some,
those often called lifestylers, it truly can be seen as something more akin to
an orientation or identity than a simple hobby, and thus be harder to separate
from every day contexts.

JM and I have both discussed the usefulness in both accepting and rejecting a
separate context for furry in our lives, depending on the scenario, and I think
this acceptance of our subculture as a slightly-less-than-real life when stood
up next to what so many of us refer to as "RL" is worth taking a step back and
looking at.  It's hardly a big thing, or an exciting thing, or a new thing, but
it does show the ways in which we differentiate furry from other things in our
lives, and even define the boundaries of what each of us considers to be the
furry fandom.
