The idea of considering furry from a mythological standpoint springs from a few
discussions over the last month or so with a friend (who has written for \[a\]\[s\]
<a href="http://adjectivespecies.com/2013/04/25/whiskey-sour/">before</a>)
about the ways in which we consider the bigger-picture topics of the fandom.
Drilling down deep into the realm of data is certainly a worthy exercise, as
all of those details help fill out the picture we carry in our heads, but just
as worthy is exploring that overview we carry along with us as a whole.

The contiguous furry subculture has relatively little in the way of its own
mythology. This is almost certainly an aspect of a subculture, rather than
something specifically furry, but no less worth investigating for that - after
all, we, as furries, are the ones who have to live with a relatively sparse
mythology. What exactly are the ramifications of that?

I know that there has been a lot of discussion recently, here on \[a\]\[s\] and
elsewhere, about what exactly makes a furry, what the fandom is, and so on.
Better minds than mine have tackled this question, and so I defer to them in
all cases. However, for the purpose of this article, I’m going to talk strictly
about what I’ve called “the contiguous fandom” in the past. That is, I’m going
to talk about self-identified furries - those who call themselves members of
our subculture and participate with that in mind. While I feel that several of
our articles might have wider reach without that consideration, I also feel
that the idea of limitations on one’s one work are a good way to keep that work
from getting out of hand. To use a bit of jargon from work, I’d really like to
avoid scope creep. With that in mind, let’s consider the question of mythology
and membership.

Anthropomorphism and mythology are deeply entwined. So deeply entwined that I
had to stop and think for a few minutes on how to even start that sentence: “is
anthropomorphism subordinate to mythology, or is it the other way around?” One
need only do the briefest of investigations into most any culture’s mythos in
order to come across some instance of anthropomorphized animals. Similarly, one
need only do a bit of research to find some bit of mythology surrounding just
about any animal one comes across. Some of these are specific, some referenced
only vaguely, but the large majority of them surround archetypes embodied by
those species.

Furry, as a whole, does not have much in the way of myths. There is likely a
very good reason to this, which I’ll get to in a bit, but first I think it’s
worth disentangling ‘myth’ and ‘archetype’. A myth is a story bearing social
weight. It’s not a story that’s important to society per se, though sometimes
it is also that, but it is one of the components that add cohesion to society.
[Knot](http://secondlina.tumblr.com/post/76073595885/here-is-knot-a-short-comic-i-drew-to-sell-at)
is an example of a modern myth which greatly exemplifies this concept. Unlike
an epic, which often includes concepts of redemption and rebirth, myths usually
surround one literary conflict and do not always resolve that conflict. In
Knot, the conflict is the princess’s sadness - or, more broadly, the concept of
depression - which, while not destroyed utterly as it might be in an epic, is
at least resolved with some sort of moral; here: not bottling up your sadness.
Myths are often the vehicles for lessons, in that way.

Archetypes, however, are more like the characters within myths. It’s not to say
that, for instance, Coyote is an archetype, but rather that Coyote embodies the
Trickster archetype. The very idea of someone clever, resourceful, not always
successful but never daunted by failures - that is the archetype, Coyote is the
actor, and the myths in which he plays a part are the vehicles for the lessons
they mean to teach. Metamyths build on top of this as a plot element, but often
include several of the same aspects as myths themselves (*Snowcrash* and
*The Diamond Age* by Neal Stephenson touch on this, and [Gunnerkrigg
Court](http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/) by Tom Siddell is a good example).

Furry has its own set of archetypes. Some of these are an artifact of what I’d
call the A-Z divide. That is, while we broadly describe our subculture in terms
of anthropomorphism, it often plays out more like zoomorphism. That is, rather
than necessarily giving animals human traits, we take our regular human
interacts and mix in animal traits - mostly desirable ones - that lead to a
coherent story. We tell our tales of human life, except with animals, or in
rarer cases, involve species as a mechanic: fennecs who hear all, the canid
sense of smell, and so on.

Apart from those, however, we have come up with a few different sources for our
own archetypes. One that might actually have its roots in the early days of the
furry fandom is the idea of “The Sexy Anubis”, though finding the actual
original source material must be left as an exercise for the reader. Although
there are surely those who have found Anubis, or at least the figure thereof,
if not the god himself, attractive, just as surely as there have been other
modern re-tellings of his role (*American Gods* by Neil Gaiman being an
obvious example), our subculture seems to have taken this and ran with it,
creating a figure that features widely in erotic art and comics. This extends
beyond Anubis, of course, on to Renamon, Krystal, and so on; as well as beyond
sexuality, as is evidenced by some species which wind up in tribal situations
more often than others (otters and wolves, I’m looking at you).

This leads me to the next source, which is that of re-purposing appropriation.
I’ve talked about appropriation more in depth <a
href="http://adjectivespecies.com/2013/04/10/appropriation-in-furry/">before</a>,
but it plays a specific role at times when creating an archetype to be used by
the community at large. Some of this shows in the ways in which we select our
mythical creatures as characters: Lunostophiles, with whom I had the original
conversation, is a Cheshire cat, and brings up that there are rather a lot of
those, as well as gryphons, dragons, and centaurs, but not as many minotaurs,
sea monsters, or mandrake roots. Much of this is due to how poorly these would
fit in with the rest of the culture that we’ve built up: one usually without
humans, whether or not they have the heads of bulls, one that takes place on
land, and one requiring mobility.

Finally, there the archetypes based in part on fact, whether or not it has been
proved. The ideas of lone wolves or strict pack hierarchy among wolves have
been disputed by science, yet still play a firm role within our subculture.
Although I’ve yet to run into any lemmings within furry, I would not be
surprised if similar attitudes surrounded them based on popular knowledge, or
even widely available fictional resources, such as the Redwall series.

In the end, perhaps this is one thing that keeps us a subculture, subservient
to other cultures’ mythos, instead of something higher. Taken this way, the
lack of canon becomes less defining. There are other subcultures that lack a
canon, such as gay culture in America in the 70s and 80s, yet which retain
visible archetypes. However, it may simply be a subculture thing to lack myths.
I’ve bookended this article in my own poor attempt at a myth that might be
found within furry, but it’s really sort of a stab in the dark, not based on
any existing archetypes.

How about you, dear readers? What archetypes do you see within furry? What
myths are there, whether or not they exist yet? Share, share!
