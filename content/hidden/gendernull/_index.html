title: Gender Null
---

<p>As part of my explorations of gender and why it intrigues me and makes me feel so strange and terrible, I took the step of modifying my hormones.  There were three main goals and one subconscious one: explore the overlap of gender and sexuality by removing sexuality; explore something that my partner had done in the past, albeit for different reasons; give myself something to write about; and no small amount of subconscious self-destructive behavior.</p>
<p>The experiment began in June, 2012, and came to an end in late October, 2012, when the lack of hormones started to drastically affect my mood.  It was a valuable experience, and I gained a lot from it, but the self-harm aspects that became clear were evidence that I needed to stop.  These are writings from that time.</p>
