Super easy and super tasty, and a perfect cool treat on a warm day.

### Ingredients

* 1 cucumber
* 2 medium tomatoes
* 1 small red onion
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* salt
* pepper
<br clear="all" />

### Preparation

1. Slice vegetables into bite sized pieces and combine with other ingredients in
a glass or ceramic bowl.
2. Refrigerate the salad for at least one hour to let the flavors mingle,
stirring at least once.
3. Serve on it's own as a light meal or on the side with a main.

Goes great with a light white such as a Riesling or Pinot Grigio.
