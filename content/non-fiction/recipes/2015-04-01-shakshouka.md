Shakshouka is a Tunisian dish consisting of a sauce made from tomatoes, peppers,
and onions, in which eggs are poached, served with crusty bread.  It's an
excellent, hearty dish to serve when it starts to get colder out.

### Ingredients

* 1 28oz can of peeled, diced tomatoes
* 3-5 Anaheim peppers
* 1 medium yellow onion
* 1/2 pound feta cheese
* 1/2 cup water
* 4 eggs
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp paprika (normal or Hungarian hot)
* 1 tsp cumin
* salt
<br clear="all" />

### Preparation

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Dice the onion and saut&eacute;e in the oil until translucent.
3. Seed and chop the peppers and add to the onions, continuing to cook while
stirring.
4. When the onions peppers are soft, add the paprika and cumin, stirring
continuously to heat the spices for a minute or so.
5. Add the tomatoes, water, and salt and stir throughly to mix.
6. Simmer the sauce for a few minutes.
7. Cube the feta cheese and stir into the sauce.
8. Once the sauce has come back to a simmer, crack the eggs gently onto the
surface and poach gently for about five minutes, occasionally spooning simmering
sauce over the whites of the eggs to help cook from the top.

Serve with a crusty bread.  Use either a spoon or the bread crust to scoop up
sauce and eggs, making sure to get a bit of everything in each bite.  Goes well
with a chilled dry white or a gin and tonic to cut through the thick, flavorful
sauce.
