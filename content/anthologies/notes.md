# Kickstarting an anthology

## Finances

120,000 words at $0.06/word comes out to $7,200 with a goal of $10,000

---|---
$7,200 | Paying authors
$800 | Cover artist
$2,000 | Other costs - contributor copies, KS rewards, etc.

## Ideas

* _Arcana_ (or other Tarot thingy) but for mainstream press
* Post-Self (or other shared-universe anthology)
* Stories about transition - maybe individual aspects or snapshots of portions rather than the whole thing
* Transition in the future - the how, the why, the social aspects, looking back historically, etc.

## Rewards

---|---
$1 | Thank you
$5 | Half digital copy
$10 | Full digital copy
$15 | Hard copy
$25 | 1 hard copy, 1 donated copy
$30 | 2 hard copies "for a friend"
$50 | Signed hard copy???

## Stretch goals

* Copies for libraries/charities (10 per $100 over?)
* Pay authors more
* Internal illustrations
* Audiobook?
