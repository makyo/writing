What does it mean to be Post-Self?

What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when you've split your sense of self among several instances? How do you react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?

How do you deal with relationships spanning instances of yourself? With jealousy, compassion, hatred, romance? What happens when you disagree with yourself? Do you cut that instance off? Halt the process?

How do you learn from your other instances? Do you merge? Rebase? Simply read about them in the paper in the morning? What ties do you have with your other instances? Are they even yours? Do you maintain a master branch or let forks deviate from the source?
