title: Rules of Sawtooth
---

[*Sawtooth*](/fiction/sawtooth/) is a fictional town in Idaho in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals. As such, there are certain rules that apply to the universe to maintain consistency:

* Interspecies relationships allowed (if frowned upon by older generations), but no hybridization
* Scent plays a big role, and similar anatomical considerations
* However, species plays only a slight role in size
* Sawtooth natives are Idaho native species
* "Noble birth" is shown through domesticated species, however, it has lately become largely discredited, and is starting to dissolve
