What if I tried to write a magical-realistic memoir? Like. It doesn't need to be totally true, and maybe some stuff gets pretty floaty, and maybe some stuff winds up as poetry, and maybe some of it is ergodic with scans of manic notes or bits of manifesto project, but it's generally just about me.

That might be neat

Myself, I guess.
