I had to sign up for Pandora in order to get a gift this year, and was presented with a required question asking my gender with the two standard options.  It's apparently required in order to provide targeted ads, which, well, okay, but boy howdy did it make me feel super awkward for some reason.  

Just kind of makes me feel like a weirdo :oP
