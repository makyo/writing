Orange sauce.  The number one condiment for a burrito the size of your head when you're down in San Jose.  Ask anyone and they'll have their preference for taquerias, with strong opinions as to who has the best orange sauce.  Despite its creamy appearance, this sauce is vegan and relies on emulsified oil and blended garlic for its texture.  For those who are curious, this one takes most after Iguana's orange sauce.

### Ingredients

* 1 head garlic
* 6-7 chipotle peppers in adobo
* Juice of two limes
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* ~1 tsp salt to taste

### Preparation

1. Separate the head of garlic into cloves, but do not peel them
2. Dry-roast the garlic cloves in a pan over medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, tossing occasionally.
3. While the garlic is roasting, add the lime juice, oil, and salt to a blender.
4. Add 6-7 chipotle peppers to the blender, slicking as much of the adobo sauce off of them and out of their insides as possible.  For a milder sauce, remove the seeds as well and rinse the peppers briefly under cold water\*.
5. When the garlic is slightly blackened, pungent, and soft, remove from heat and peel, adding the cloves to the blender.
6. Blend thoroughly until you wind up with a creamy orange- to rust-colored sauce.

Keep the sauce refrigerated in a container or squeeze bottle.  Serve with any good Mexi-Cali food, such as a burrito the size of your head or a chicken and avocado quesadilla.  Pair with a good margarita!

\* Don't throw away the adobo sauce!  You can freeze the sauce and any leftover peppers in an ice cube tray, separating each few teaspoons of sauce or each pepper into its own slot.  To keep the sauce from staining the tray, you can line the tray with plastic wrap first.  These "spice cubes" can be added to other meals for a good, smoky kick.
