Hey!  I haven't had the energy to write for a little while, so I've fallen way
behind, but that doesn't mean that I haven't been reading, so I now have a huge
backlog of links.  Given that still don't have the energy to write a full post
for each, I figure I'll just do a little round up here with a little blurb about
each so that a) I'm still writing but b) I'm not spending all day writing :o)

In no particular order...

* [d/sphoria] [1] (NSFW)- I loooove this, particularly as it relates to myself
  in more than one way.  There's the dysphoria aspect, of course, but the idea of
  moving sex away from orgasm has been particularly important to both James and
  myself over the last few months.  It's been an interesting exploration, for
  sure.
* [The Distress of the Privileged] [2] - This is a pretty interesting article on
  just how privilege works and how there is distress on both sides of an issue
  that involves such things.  Notable especially with regards to some recent
  conversations on language and interaction that have taken place on Twitter.
* [Beyond the Binary: What's the difference between genderqueer and
  genderfluid?] [3] - I found this interesting mostly for the different ways in
  which people think about these two terms, and others like them.  People have
  different reasons for using the labels they do, of course, and that leads to
  these different interpretations.
* [Arriva train driver skirt protester] [4]: I...kinda want that skirt :S
* [I'm a trans woman and I'm not interested in being one of the good ones] [5] -
  I really like this sentiment.  I really have a hard time with the concept of
  gatekeeping, sometimes, and I still hesitate to use all but the vaguest terms
  for myself out of...well, fear, I suppose.  Fear that I'm simply not X enough.
  Again, I think this is pretty pertinent to a lot of recent discussions I've
  had online.
* [Seven Transphobic Tropes Debunked] [6] and [Fighting misogyny within
  feminism] [7] - These two articles seem to go hand in hand.  There are a lot
  of ways in which anti-trans\* sentiment is espoused, and these do a good job
  of dissecting and doing their best to debunk those sentiments.
