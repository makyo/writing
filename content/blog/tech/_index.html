<p>I've been into computers for a while, and so it was that my choice of majors in school, music composition, came as a surprise rather than most anything else in life.  Even with that, though, I wound up in software development anyway.  I'm currently a developer at Internet Archive and spend much of my time working on and thinking about open source software.  I figure it's only a short step to start writing about it, as well.</p>
