Wh...well...ah, hmm.

It may be worth reading the letter that actually inspired Wonkette's post, here.

You know, I just recently had a discussion over Twitter about how, when I was in elementary school, a friend of mine roleplayed The Phantom of the Opera over and over again, except Raoul was bad, the Phantom was good, and we may have been kitties, as well.  There were plaster Phantom masks and interpretive dance on the playground balance beam in front of our parents. There was, as far as I can tell, any discussions of how manly I was.  Maybe I was a little sheltered, though probably much more than a little, but I simply cannot...make this guy's ideas work.

snow white and the huntsman is such a film. when my boys were young i would never have allowed them to go to such a film for i believe it would injure their developing manhood. if i would not let my own sons see it, why would i want to publish anything about it?

It really makes me wonder where my developing manhood\* went.  I mean, I wound up a cyclist and a programmer, and my friend wound up going to MIT and excelling as a gymnast outside her classes.
