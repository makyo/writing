I follow a neat twitter account, [@TransMediaWatch](http://twitter.com/transmediawatch), which posts articles from the UK daily about gender news of all sorts, and this came up as a negative counterpoint to a more positively worded article.  It's certainly a very poorly written article.  There's a lot of weird phrasing that's just sort of, kind of, maybe trying to hide a bias, but not really succeeding, including good examples of using an adjective to objectify, as in "the transsexual hails from...".  It seems that the Telegraph tends to do a better job both of posting relatively okays, and posting corrections when TMW calls them out.

Edit: copied title corrected.
