title: Holiday Donations
---

Hi!  Thanks for reading this.  After the success of last year's combined drive
on Twitter, and in memory of my pup Millie, I will be donating $1 to the [Humane
Society of the United States](http://www.humanesociety.org/) for every retweet
of [this status update on
twitter](https://twitter.com/drab_makyo/status/408284722972749824).  

Additionally, I will be donating $1 to the [Humane Society of Boulder
Valley](http://boulderhumane.org) for ever retweet of [this status update on
twitter](https://twitter.com/drab_makyo/status/408378552023666688).

I will donate no less than $500 to each charity, and no more than $2000 total (I
still have to support the house!), but if the numbers differ, I will use the
*larger* number for both (again, up to $2000); this isn't a popularity contest,
just a fun way to help with giving for the holidays!

### Why?

I've got a lot of stuff.  *We* have a lot of stuff.  It's just part of the
accumulated past of more than two families.  The last thing we really need is
more *things*.  In that vein, and after [the experience of donating to the ASPCA
last year](http://adjectivespecies.com/2012/12/19/on-giving/), I've decided to
repeat the experiment.

Additionally, due to cancer and internal bleeding, [my dog Millie was put down
earlier this year](/posts/personal/2013/10/06/millie/).  Millie was adopted from
the Humane Society of Boulder after her previous owner had tried to make a
fighting dog of her.  Fed up with her inability to be anything but a sweetheart,
he kicked her and broke her back leg, which then healed improperly.  Even so,
she was a trooper, and followed my mom on hikes for years.  This is one small
thing I can do in her honor.

### The Charities

The Humane Society of the United States is [highly
rated](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3848#.Up9ierWJDAQ)
on Charity Navigator in finances as well as accountability and transparency.

Mission:

> The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is the nation's largest and most
> effective animal protection organization. Established in 1954, The HSUS seeks a
> humane and sustainable world for all animals - a world that will also benefit
> people. We work to reduce suffering and to create meaningful social change for
> animals by advocating for sensible public policies, investigating cruelty and
> working to enforce existing laws, educating the public about animal issues,
> joining with corporations on behalf of animal-friendly policies, and conducting
> hands-on programs that make ours a more humane world. We are the lead disaster
> relief agency for animals, and we provide direct care for thousands of animals
> at our sanctuaries and rescue facilities, wildlife rehabilitation centers, and
> mobile veterinary clinics.

It was brought to my attention that it is not clear that HSUS is *not*
affiliated with local Humane Societies, though they do operate shelters in five
states and work with various local shelters throughout the US.  This isn't a
statement about either HSUS or local shelters, as both do fantastic work!  In
order to more properly address this concern, I will also be donating to The
Humane Society of Boulder Valley, the shelter that took in Millie, as well as
one of our current pups, Falcon!

Mission:

> It is the mission of the Humane Society of Boulder Valley to protect and
> enhance the lives of companion animals by promoting healthy relationships
> between pets and people. We were founded more than a century ago in 1902, yet
> this mission holds true today as we counter animal neglect and cruelty and
> partner with other animal welfare organizations, sharing our mutual mission of
> saving more animals' lives.
