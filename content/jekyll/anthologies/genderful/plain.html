<h3>Genderful: White and Gold</h3>
<p>As furries, we base large swaths of our identity around species. We search for what fits, we let our species choose us, and find ways to be happy as such.</p>
<p>Species isn't the only portion of identity that we explore within this subculture, though; given the relative safety of our community, gender is also something that we frequently explore. More than 8% of furries describe themselves as non-cisgender, and a further 6% describe their gender as 'complicated'<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furry is often a means of wish-fulfillment for us, the players of our characters and the bearers of our avatars, so we often present ourselves as we desire to be seen. Within a fictional furry world, though, there's little reason to expect that similar statistics around gender identity and expression would not also be the case.</p>
<p>How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a day-to-day context? What are the mechanics of hormone replacement therapy - transdermal patches obviously being out of the question - or of gender affirming surgery? What are the social implications of gender transition in a society already differentiated by species?</p>
<p><strong><em>Genderful</em></strong> is a furry fiction anthology which aims to explore these questions, letting them play out over the course of 5,000-10,000 words. Though the set and setting may be tough and the plot may involve hardships, the characters should be treated with sensitivity and care. <em>White and Gold</em> is the general side of the anthology. Stories will be general audience, and adult stories will be offered in a separate section to allow readers to curate their experience.</p>

<h3>Genderful: Black and Silver</h3>
<p>As furries, we base large swaths of our identity around species. We search for what fits, we let our species choose us, and find ways to be happy as such.</p>
<p>Species isn't the only portion of identity that we explore within this subculture, though; given the relative safety of our community, gender is also something that we frequently explore. More than 8% of furries describe themselves as non-cisgender, and a further 6% describe their gender as 'complicated'<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furry is often a means of wish-fulfillment for us, the players of our characters and the bearers of our avatars, so we often present ourselves as we desire to be seen. Within a fictional furry world, though, there's little reason to expect that similar statistics around gender identity and expression would not also be the case.</p>
<p>How would those in a such a world explore their gender in a sexual context? What are the effects of hormone replacement therapy or of gender affirming surgery on one's sexuality? How does sex and sexuality work in a setting with complex scents and sensitive noses? Dating, already scary, gains a new layer of tension; romance, already complex, gains a new layer of difficulty; and sex, already fraught with gender, becomes even more complicated.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genderful</em></strong> is a furry fiction anthology which aims to explore these questions, letting them play out over the course of 5,000-10,000 words. Though the set and setting may be tough and the plot may involve hardships, the characters should be treated with sensitivity and care. <em>Black and Silver</em> is the adult side of the anthology. Stories will be adult in nature, and general audience stories will be offered in a separate section to allow readers to curate their experience.</p>
