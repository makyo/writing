Madison Scott-Clary, Sometimes seen around as Makyo, is a writer, editor, and publisher living in the Pacific Northwest. She has been writing seriously since sixth great when she discovered that she really rather liked writing five paragraph essays.

In 2011, she founded [adjective][species], a metafurry resource, as writer and editor-in-chief. [a][s] featured essays, art, and data surrounding the furry subculture, a process of exploration to help us, as furries, figure out what went into our own subculture. Shortly thereafter, the project took ownership of the Furry Survey, the fandom's largest yearly market and demographic survey, which it hosts to this day.

Beginning in 2016, she edited *Arcana - A Tarot Anthology* for Thurston Howl Publications. *Arcana* collected 22 stories - one for each of the 22 major arcana in a western Tarot deck - from authors all around the furry subculture. The anthology was published in 2017.

In 2017, she joined forces with Thurston Howl Publications as an editor, where she helped with long-form fiction queries. In this role, she would work with both authors and publishers to select submissions and help find a path forward to their publication.

In 2017, she assumed - and later stepped down from - the role of president of the Furry Writers' Guild, where she spearheaded efforts to define the Guild's role and to help with the mechanics of inter-guild social interaction.

In late 2017, Madison helped found Hybrid Ink, LLC, an independent publisher based out of the Pacific northwest, focused on thoughtful writing, fiction and nonfiction, from prose to verse. Hybrid's first publication, the novel *My Dinner With Andrea* by Jen Durbent will be out March 1, 2018.

Outside of [adjective][species], Madison has had essays published by Thurston Howl Publications in *Furries Among Us 2* and on The New Stack, a tech news site.

Her story *Foxes and Milkshakes* was published in the Further Confusion conbook in 2015.

Her poem 'The dogs assure me' was published in Civilized Beasts II, released in 2017.
