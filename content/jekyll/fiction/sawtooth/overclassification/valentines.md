Dani rarely thought of Amber.

Initially, the idea had concerned her, that someone had affected her life so greatly had slipped so easily from her mind. She'd wanted to latch onto that weekend and try to internalize it, but some part of her either already had or wasn't ready to. Which one it was depended on the time of day.

The ringtail had accepted the warmth Dani had offered, gratefully and gracefully, and then left without a sound, minimizing the impact her presence had had on the otter. That was the safe path, and, when Dani did think about it, she realized that it was Amber's way of staying safe; to expect anything more would be to impose her will on someone with plans for her own life.

And so Dani rarely thought of Amber. She worked. The cold-spell lifted. She read and watched movies. She ate alone.

And while she wasn't happy, neither did that fog of depression settle down on her after her guest had left. They'd both made it through the spell, each in their own way.

And, once a day, almost without thinking of it, she'd tell herself a story in her head.
