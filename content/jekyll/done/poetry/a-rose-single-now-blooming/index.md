title: A rose, single, now blooming
---

<div class="verse">
A rose, single, now blooming
    may indeed bless the stem,
yet are not roses clipp’d and shown?
    Undoubted ‘tis a blessing to them
who receive such a gift!
    Yet now unmade is the flow’r
which adorns thy mantle with its grace
    and withers, however slowly, by the hour,
        until ‘tis faded to nothing and dust,
        though some scent remain forever amidst the must.

A rose, single, now blooming
    is perhaps best left on the stem,
its beauty to be admired amidst the growth.
    Surely 'tis better to long for that gem,
than witness beauty wilt and dry!
    Yet now one must long indeed, must burn,
Must yearn forever for that grace.
    To watch that growth, to explore stem's turn,
        day by day would destroy, weakening one by the hour,
        A rose, single, now blooming, forever holds all pow'r.
