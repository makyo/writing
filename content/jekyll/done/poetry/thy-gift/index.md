title: Thy gift
---

<div class="verse">
I reach for the ewer of water,
I hope to quench the heat.
I beg for yet another serving,
I hope to fill my need.

The water &mdash; cool &mdash; cools not
Without thy merry presence.
The food fills, passes, is gone &mdash;
Yet leaves me empty, yearning.

Though the heart may quicken &mdash;
Though the tongue may lap &mdash;
I shall sup no greater meal
Than thy gift entrancing.
</div>
