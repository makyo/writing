title: You find me at a disadvantage
---

<div class="verse">
On reading letters late received,
I felt within: the fox &mdash;
Yelping, yowling now, crying needfully &mdash;
Myself, a craving beast.

You find me at a disadvantage &mdash;
Panting and aswish &mdash;
Would that distance be traversed as easily
As hearts tâ€™wards yearning hearts!
</div>
