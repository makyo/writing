I hereby resign from the office of president of the Furry Writers' Guild, effective immediately.

There are two reasons for this.

The first is that I'm not at all well. That's between me, my family (chosen and biological), and the various doctors involved. It shouldn't affect the Guild, but it's not compatible with me staying in this role.

The second is that the strength of the guild lies in the social interactions that it provides, and that is something I'm *fantastically* bad at, when it comes to leadership roles. For that reason, I recused myself of moderation early on, but that's certainly not helped anything, and may have made things worse. The Guild deserves better.

The follow-up procedure is as so:

* Chipotle is to be president *pro tempore*
* There will be an emergency election for the office of president within one month

I wish the Guild and its membership nothing but the best.

You may find me on Twitter as @drab_makyo or @makyo_writes, on Telegram as @DrabMakyo, or over email as makyo@drab-makyo.com, but for now, I'm stepping away from the forums and Slack until health stuff is resolved.

Forever in your debt,

Madison Scott-Clary
