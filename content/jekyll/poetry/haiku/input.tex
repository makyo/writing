\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  A measure of grain\\
  and a measure of water ---\\
  spring's own time and heat

  Air carries the scent\\
  of myriads of lives spent\\
  on summer's warm breath

  Crumb and density,\\
  warmth buried beneath crisp crust ---\\
  autumn's crackling leaves.

  Loves and loaves and loaves\\
  baked for comfort in the cold ---\\
  winter calls for stores.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  Leaves fall, grass withers,\\
  and I step back to witness\\
  winter's frozen form.

  Half an hour's silence,\\
  body relaxing slowly,\\
  letting springtime in.

  A season to stretch,\\
  then one to learn everything ---\\
  summer's exploring.

  What will autumn bring?\\
  Maturity? Strength? Wisdom?\\
  Dry heat and cool nights?
\end{verse}
