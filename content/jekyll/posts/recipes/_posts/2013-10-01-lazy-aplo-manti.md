title: Lazy Aplo Manti
---

Manti is a Greek dish comprising bulgar, ground meat, and spices mixed together
in a dumpling made with phyllo dough.  Aplo Manti (or mock Manti) is a similar
dish - the filling in a casserole covered with leaves of the paper-thin dough
instead, leading to much faster preparation times.

This is even lazier.  We bypass the phyllo in favor of a sort of mixed casserole
of grain and vegetables, with optional meat and cheese.  As I make it vegetarian
most of the time in a house full of meat-eaters, we often call it "rabbit food".
However, it disappears quickly every time.

### Ingredients

* 1 cup bulgar
* 2 cups broth (veggie or chicken)
* 1 small jar artichoke hearts, marinated and quartered
* 1 chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* dill
* salt and pepper

Optional:

* 1-2 additional veggies (summer squash, string beans, eggplant, etc)
* 1/2 block feta, cubed
* 1-2 Italian style sausages (about half a pound), sliced
* 5-10 diced kalamata olives
* 1 tsp lemon juice

### Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 375F.
2. Combine everything in a casserole with at least half an inch to spare at the
   lip.
3. Bake for approximately one hour, stirring once.

This is good with a lighter ros&eacute; or white wine, as it comes out rather
full flavored.  Leftovers reheat best by saut&eacute;eing in a good olive oil.
