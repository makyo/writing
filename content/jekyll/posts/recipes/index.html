<p>I cook.  A lot. I always have.  At least, ever since my dad convinced me when I was about 10 that cooking was the most valuable thing one could learn in the world.  I know this doesn't really fit in with the whole writing thing, but I'm going to have to post these somewhere, and really, Markdown works amazingly for recipes, so here you go!</p>

<ul>
    {% for post in site.categories.recipes %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> posted in 
    {% for category in post.categories %}{% if category != "posts" %}
    <a href="/posts/{{ category }}">{{ category }}</a>{% if forloop.last != true %},{% endif %} 
    {% endif %}{% endfor %} 
    on {{ post.date|date_to_string }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
