title: On Gender
---

<p>Gender is a big thing.  A huge thing.  It's bigger than a lot of people give it credit, and I think that's something that I started to understand in my early twenties, when it started to cause some distress for me.  It's not a binary, and even calling it a spectrum seems to deny a lot of the depth behind the social and psychological construction that is gender.</p>
<p>I've been exploring gender for a while now in a few different ways, but am only just starting to write about it.  I started with a Tumblr blog, which I've moved here (though it's still mirrored <a href="http://androgynousfox.tumblr.com">there</a>), but will be adding additional writings as time goes on.</p>
