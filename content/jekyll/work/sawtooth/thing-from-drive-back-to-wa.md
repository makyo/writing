Danny took the bus to the edge of Sawtooth, basically as close as he could get to I-84 on local transit. Beyond here it was all industrial. All warehouses and junkyards and hulking, silent buildings painted grey or beige, or not painted at all. Machine shops, garages, or simply anonymous buildings with rows of doors and loading docks. Beyond here, there was no living. It was a liminal space.

That was okay. He just needed out of this town. This stupid fucking town. This brown and flat and sad town. This restless town. This home to ennui and melancholy. This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the middle of an apathetic landscape like hay from an overturned truck.

He walked from there.

He walked past the buildings until the parking lots were replaced with fields and, eventually, the buildings were too.

He walked until the sound of the interstate grew from the sound of wind to the sound of a waterfall, and from there to the sound of wheels on pavement.

He walked along the county road, across the bridge over the freeway.

He kept walking.

At fifteen, Danny had been a gawky and anxious cat. Too anxious. Too gawky. He took to slinking around school from class to class in silence, letting his overful backpack propel him down the halls, walking close to the walls. Any time not spent in the desk furthest from the door daydreaming was spent in front of one of the computers in the lab.

Sawtooth High had a few computer classes, but none of them warranted the lab that the school had. Twenty relatively high-end machines --- at least, higher end than would ever be needed for the two typing classes and the HTML class offered by the school --- and Danny's favorite, two linux machines tucked away in a corner. Babylon and Enterprise.
