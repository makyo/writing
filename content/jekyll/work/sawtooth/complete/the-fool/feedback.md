### Rob

You have a real gift for... I do not know how to describe it, exactly; "poetry" is the closest word. You can do a lot with an economy of words in describing something that is both effective and beautiful. At a high-level answer to the questions you posed at the start of the story: I think there's an appropriate arc, yes; I don't think anything about Avery's character, species or gender feels bolted on; I wouldn't have caught the arc words if you can't called it out.

The idea of a tarot session as, more or less, talk therapy is really, really intriguing to me. You do a beautiful job of stripping away any pure mysticism to it and making it an act of guided self-discovery; it's an inspired decision and I think that's probably what gives the plot arc weight. I think parts of it are definitely 'convenient,' for the purposes of the plot; we'd expect that kind of self-discovery to take months or longer maybe, in the real world, but it doesn't actually feel that way. Everything is earned, everything makes sense, and the fact that it's not ended, pat at the end gives the kind of ambiguity and a sort of empowering proteanness to self-identity a real significance. I think that part works really, really well.

I don't know "why" necessarily, but the three lines that stood out for me as just fantastically evocative are all about self-description. "Dingy clothes draped over a broad frame I never wanted"; "A darker animal dressed in those would look rough and tumble, ready for a hike. A mountain lion looks like a mess of dirty laundry."; "I feel unfortunately tall. A rectangle. A lummox. A big, dumb cat." They're really, really poignant. They work really, really well.

This is my initial feedback. I think it works really well. It's a good example of a story in which so much happens in such small, intimate ways.
