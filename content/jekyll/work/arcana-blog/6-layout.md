# Layout

* LaTeX
* Document structure
* The cards
* The frontmatter
* The backmatter
* Details (overview, details for latex book)
    * Draft watermark
    * Font
    * Packages
    * Page layout
    * Pretitle
    * Secdiv
    * Story
    * Title
    * ToC
* Aside: remember that this is not a program, it is a script. Neither is it semantic, like a webpage. If you want the text bigger for a title, you don't need to identify it as such. Focus on the look, you don't need to worry about the "meaning" of your markup commands. As long as it's repeatable (same thing each time you run it and on each computer), you don't need to do anything else.
* Marking proof: X passes through the manuscript
    * based off "Seven Trips Through the Score"
        1. Instrumentation and transpositions
        2. Form analysis
        3. Harmonic structure
        4. Melodic line and its instrumentation
        5. Phrasal analysis
        6. Dynamics
        7. Special effects in the score and manner of execution on the instruments
    * Printing proof (4x4 pages on 11x17 portrait double sided)
    * Manuscript markup (NB: only pointing out problem places, not fixing inline):
        1. Frame violations (should be taken care of by details, but)
        2. Page breaks: widows/orphans and secdivs
        3. Line breaks: awkward hyphenations
* Polishing manuscript
