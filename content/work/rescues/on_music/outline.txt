Creation
	Source?
		Logical - following theoretical guidelines to produce an entertaining/aesthetically pleasing/interesting/whatever piece
			Form
			Process
		Creative - using some nebulous concept to somehow generate music
			Music as medium - always there, just modulated by composer into written notation - mystical
			Inspiration from another source - programatic or idealistic
		Combination
			Most likely
			Creativity is the source of the piece, logic is its execution
	programmatic music vs absolute music
		programmatic
			is it useful to have someone else know the program?
				programs applied post facto as a disservice to the music, listeners can't think of anything else?
		absolute
			process music
		debates as to the use of critics, theoricians, and analysts after the fact
	Working as a composer
		Notation as friend
			How much to write in score vs. how much to trust performers' musicality
			clarity vs. neatness
		Intellectual property, argh
			Licensing
			Royalties
		The composer's role in music after publishing - is what is written The Law?
		Audiences
			Lectures/Q&A/talks: what they want to hear vs. what you want to say
			Catering to the audiences vs. writing for self.
