Rehearsal Techniques
concert - work is done - this is payoff
knowing how to work
teachers primarily (what do we teach every day)
help students become independent musicians (better)
pitfalls - try to do everything for student - don't give students any space - CD least effective way of teaching (may get product)
benevolent dictator!
choose appropriate repertoire for each ensemble
	Choir rebels: almost always about person, not about music - build trust, make students know that this is good
		New Teacher w/ new music, students rebel because treat as group, not soloists
			prev teachers picked rep to highlight soli, thus more about person, new style teaching for group
music = tool 
- get good tools (good music subjective)
- language - latin easiest, good for teaching vowels, phrasing, articulation
- mainstream - palastrina to '50s, proven, give whats good for students
- research - what does music teach? too hard? research to fit ensemble (transcription, transposition)
- back-up plan rep, but.. not about sudents, about self b/c students will never learn more than teacher knows
- Have high expectations
rehearsal
- sight read ALL THE TIME
- "listen", not "watch me": focus on one, lose the other, stop conducting sometimes
	internalize
- interact - ask questions
- always conduct best students ~ 10% ~ create leaders, not boredom
- give them reason to watch you: never stop MAKING MUSIC
- be respectful: "ladies", "gentlemen", etc: treat them that way and they will act that way
	"Let us", "could we", not "let me"
	Be inclusive of rest of choir
- Involve as many parts as possible, no boredom, no singling out, stay focused
- always give reasons for work "lets go back and fix.."
- always give feedback, but be honest "that was the idea but if __ it would be better"
- use vague terms, often works because students think, "beautiful", "musical", "expressive"
	sometimes: "that was not good" make them think about why
- no hipocrisy! always do it yourself first
- admit mistakes and fault or at least don't blame students if not their fault
- dont talk too much - as much music as possible
- dont leave others behind (ie some work on notes some on phrasing), but always give everyone work
- always do everything - phrasing and articulation while learning notes
- ensemble - everyone should be complimentary - creative seating and paring of abilities
- plan for productive rehearsal - macro: battle plan -> micro: attack plan
  - in general: early: big picture, mid: small details, end: put it together (milestones!)
  - plan times (milestones!)
  - dont eschew explanation: change concept of macro based on a piece (ie epitaph for moonlight)
overperfection
- process vs product
- humanity + emotion vs being polished
- no overrehearsing
  - overpolished
  - getting stuck/bored
  - music loses warmth
  - lost expressivity
  - cold, straight tone
  - from conductors wishes
    - sound vs music
    - sound has to fit music and text, not the choir
    - people dont listen to sound, but music
    - conducting follows music, after all
conductor
- breathing
- text + nuances - speak it
- know difficulties and why
  - voice difficulties (passagio)
  - keys (flats better, more flats more betteR)
lack of trust shown in focusing on direction instead of rebound
rehearsal techs:
- fine tuning vowels (english is difficult) when ascending, think down; when descending, think up
- phrasing and breathing - breathiness
- purpose of rehearsal: diagnose problem (isolate), provide remedy
  - demonstrate (more)/explain (less)
  - then feedback
- teach students EVERYTHING at the same time (because practice makes permanent)
doing too much/wrong things - easier to ask forgiveness than permission
what goes up must come down and vice versa - natural cycles in conducting and music
no choral conducting, no instrumental conducting, just conducting
paint a picture with conducting
- Britten
  - dry ice
  - phantom: setting up mood before, phantom appears at "thou art the king.."
- adjectives to go with every section, every note
problem directors
- self control
- admitting mistakes
- self confidence and respect -> respect others
- no apologies: dictatorship
- ensemble never knows more than conductor: always know more
- own the piece
- self deprecation to make a point
- line between student and conductor
- give reasons/justification
- dont get used to choir
- empathy with singers - lots of work for them
q: why aren't you singing what I want? a: why aren't you showing what you want?
