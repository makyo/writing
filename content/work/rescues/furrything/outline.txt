Post apocalyptic society

three groups 
- Tenoctitli (Tenoc) leads those who want to go back to past based on vision he had
- Yovan leads those who want to stay where they are
- Collective wants to move forward into something new

Tenoc's group grows in power, starts fighting against Collective, Yovan's group caught in the middle.  Eventually, Tenoc dies in battle, finds out on his death bed that the vision he's been seeking is actually the goal of the collective, but that it's something new, not old as he'd thought.  New goal is to live with the consequences of the war that brought about apocalypse, rather than go back to how things were.  War was nanotech, changed people (mix between Diamond Age and Ilium), Collective uses this, Tenoc doesn't.  Turns out that the part of the Collective that's fighting is the lower eschelon; upper eschelon have removed themselves from fighting, nonviolent but generally very powerful (magic/sufficiently advanced technology).

Sintoac/Sintoaci - vaguely otterlike - Tenoc
Varanya - like clouded leopards - Yovan
Collective - all species, but mostly an unnamed one sorta like grayscale canids
