\subsubsection*{The Background}
While reading back through some previous entries in this experiment as
well as some of my other writings on similarly esoteric topics, I found
that a lot of my writing was pretty disappointing.  It's not that I
think I'm adopting the wrong tone or that I'm bad at writing.  Rather, I
think my writing is pretty consistent across all of these topics.
However, I've noticed that I sound like, to be blunt, a neohippie.  I
sound like I'm writing a book that you would find in an incense laden
basement shop with soft-spoken, hand-dyed fabric wearing shop-owners,
all of whom have long gray hair.

I have nothing against the aging hippie bookstore owning crowd, but the
majority of the books they sell seem to be written by self-important
people who come off as being more intelligent than the rest of us, each
of whom has the secrets to the universe as given to them by aliens, God,
or drugs.  Perhaps this is just another case of cynicism --- they do
seem to strike me fairly often nowdays --- but I'm not aiming to write
in this style.  I believe that there is a dearth of good writings about
individual spiritualities and actual examples of people using these to
constructively better themselves.  Does that make me self-important and
more intelligent?  No, I simply think that this may help me, and might
only help others by making me a better person to those around me.

Truth be told, I'm having doubts that this is a genuine thing for me to
do.  I am unsure that what I'm doing is actually improving myself or
doing something completely different.  Who can I ask?  Since I'm still 
in the middle of the thing, I looked into the matter using the cards.

\subsubsection*{The Drawing}
Being most comfortable with it, I used the Universal
Waite\cite{tarotRWS} deck again.
