(confirm)  2) not so easy because always questioning faith; maybe questioning whether he should settle down in his faith?  3)difficult by definition, should be able to take changes into account without having to question faith - what are the inherent problems with this?  Maybe questioning faith is good for us?  Could be argument with first relationship about being too accepting?
