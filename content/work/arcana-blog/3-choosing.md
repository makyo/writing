# Choosing

* Points
* Tough spots
    * Close scores
    * tiebreakers:
        * Over/undersaturation (one contemporary and the rest scifi? probably not a good fit)
        * For arcana: fit within order (too many scifi in a row)
        * Author already represented
        * Third parties/other slushers
* Voice, theme, and consistency
