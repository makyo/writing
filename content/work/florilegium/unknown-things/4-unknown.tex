\section*{The Elevation of Unknown Things}

((God comes down, Job's three friends forgive him, in a way, yet Elihu is not mentioned.\footnote{I've heard said in the past that "forgiveness is releasing the hope for a better past" \parencite{wakefield} but it's more complicated than that, isn't it? That quote itself is more complicated than that:

\begin{verse}
There are ways around being the go-to person \\
even for ourselves \\
even when the answer is clear \\
clear like the holy water Gentiles would drink \\
before they realized \\
forgiveness is the release of all hope for a better past
\end{verse}

Primed as we are to take text out of context, wrap our own needs around it, and pretend that it is in all ways applicable to all situations (for did I not already bring up mistaking accidental, individual symbols for universal ones?), it's so easy to misremember that the better past we hope for is just some dream, some thing we cling to long after the us that lived that past has died.

Who knows if I was the go-to person, the punching bag for my Elihu, the object of their simple angers? Who knows if they remember me? They cut contact, without telling me, without telling me why, and who knows if they even know the reason?

Who cares, other than me?}))
