Thanks, as always, to the polycule, who has been endlessly supportive, as well as to Nenekiri, Utunu, and many others who helped with reading and keeping me sane along the way.

Thanks also to my patrons:

Mitzvot was made possible through a Kickstarter campaign, and the entirety of the Post-Self cycle would not be what it is without the support of so many backers. The response went far beyond what I had ever hoped, and I am honored to have the chance to provide what I can in return.

Thank you to the following:

  Because Madison will always mean so much to me, I suppose that I can forgive this series' relative lack of good cats.

  \item[Michael Miele]
  I'm Michael Miele, but most folks online know me as my dragon fursona, Nenekiri Bookwyrm. I've been pretty active in furry writing spaces with reading and reviewing books from authors in the community. If memory serves, Madison reached out to me after finding my review of Qoheleth and asked me if I wanted to get Toledot early in exchange for an honest review. I said yes, of course, and she was kind enough to do so again for Nevi'im and Mitzvot later.

  As a writer whose work I respect and adore for various reasons, it means an immense amount to me that she would trust me with giving feedback for the Post-Self series of books. While a writer myself, I don’t have the same amount of experience Madison does, so the whole process has been very flattering.

  The mixture of transhumanism, queer lived experience, and programming in-jokes made books I, a queer furry programmer, was excited to read each time. I hope my reviews have helped other folks get lost (in a positive way!) in the Ode and Bălan clade's stories.

  Curl up with a good book and be kind to yourself.
