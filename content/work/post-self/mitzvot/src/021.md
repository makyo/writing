((Show how it looks when May starts to overflow. Won't get out of bed, won't speak, just barely keeping emotions in check. Ioan  makes preparations on eir own: food for a few days, changing ACLs so that TN will be dropped in entryway to wait for permission to enter (doesn't wind up being needed). Leaves for Douglas's, has a good cry out in the field before going inside))
