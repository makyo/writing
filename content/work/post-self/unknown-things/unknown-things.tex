\section*{Abstract}

Founded in 2115 CE (nine years prior to systime 0), the construct containing uploaded personalities commonly known as the System has exploded in population to an estimated twenty-seven billion individuals with countless more instances forked from those core identities. A world that is stable, beyond scarcity, and beyond even death, appeals to a great many people, and through incentives provided by political entities phys-side, transition from physical to uploaded life has been made as smooth as possible. The transition of religions and spirituality from life on Earth to the System has been less than seamless, however. We intend to explore the incidence and applicability of a wide array of generalized religious beliefs as they occur in societies built of immortal individuals, comparing them against their mortal roots on Earth. Through this survey we hope to hope to divine what aspects of spiritual life are bound more firmly to physicality and readily apparent mortality with an eye towards avoiding supercessionist language.
