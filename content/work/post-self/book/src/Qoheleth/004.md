# Qoheleth --- 2305

Qoheleth is a patient man.

I have time. Enough time, at least. I know I'm gone. My memory, split as it is across an archive and nearly thirty exos, is a millstone around my neck. It drags me down. It drowns me even in plentiful air. I can feel the way it crams up against every recess of my skull, demanding to be let out. The Name, the Ode, every act since uploading as so many that Michel took --- that *I* took --- before that. It drags me down. It nips at my heels. It fogs my vision. There are no metaphors that clearly show just how horrifying the inability is to forget, and so I find myself reaching for every analogy that I can find.

I'm a lost cause, but much of the clade still has their faculties about them. I think so, at least. I hope so. So long as they act within the decade, we'll be here. Any longer, and we'll risk further degradation, further madness.

It's been two weeks since I pinged Dear --- lovely Dear --- and although it had tried to contact me several times, and pinged countless more, I never responded. I did my part. I called them, got them fighting, got them interested, and I think I got them invested.

That's all I need, is for them to be invested.

Now, hopefully they will come.
