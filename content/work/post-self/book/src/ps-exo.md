title: Qoheleth
---

The basic structure is in two threads: the plot from Qoheleth intertwined with the plot from Exocortices, with the shared theme of memory and forgetting. Dear can't forget RJ, RJ can't forget information while lost. The lost lead to tech required for uploading.

Also includes short stories: Apres un reve, Gallery Exhibition. More? The poem?

Includes appendix about both threads.

## Todo

* RJ would have listed Sasha as a contact along with parents. She should know (even if not at first) that ey was lost
* If Sasha is Michel and Dear is Michel, then Sasha should have thoughts on being an artist. Perhaps held back by need to survive, thus teaching?
* Also, perhaps Sasha swore off relationships after RJ died, thus Dear being shaky on relationships.
* Dear promises to discuss Umwelten with Ioan at the end
