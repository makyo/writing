The Only Time I Know My True Name Is When I Dream walked.

She walked from sim to sim, finding intricate ways to build up a sign, a sigil from them. Finding ways for disparate streets to connect, finding alleyways that opened into deer paths, finding breathlessly exposed parks that, when a corner was turned around a tree or perhaps a low hill, opened out again into the lobbies of libraries, the shelves of which became a hedge maze.

Perhaps there was more to the sims that she walked, but she did not notice. As soon as she felt herself drawn to any one particular place, any one particular feature of any one particular sim, she left. All of the things that people — her people — built passed beneath her feet, passed before her eyes.

And all the time, her thoughts soared above her, watching her path, the steps she took. They watched all of her left turns. They viewed the sigil that her walking drew and imbued in it new meaning.

A thought: \emph{What dire emotional need caused one to build an office building in a place of no corporations?}

She stepped into that office building, walked up two flights of stairs, and into a floor of empty cubicles. She turned at random, moving through the rows, and sat down at one of the desks and thought a while.

A thought: \emph{Why is the first instinct upon creating a wholly blank medium such as this to build in the nature we remember?}

She stepped from the cubicle and turned left, out into a rolling, open field, dotted throughout with dandelions. She bent down and picked one, twirling it between finger and thumb, then tucking it behind her ear where the yellow could shine bright amidst the black fur there.

A thought: \emph{Why do we drag our memories around with us like luggage?}

So, she walked, and as she walked, she strove to draw her thoughts in the other direction. She strove to draw them forward, away from the past, so that she could consider the future.

What would this place look like, after seceding from the rest of the world? What would a land — if such could be said of the System — of those who had already seceded from the rest of humanity look like? How many would notice and rejoice? How many would notice and hate every second of it? How many would notice and not care, and how many would not even know that it had happened, that it had even been on the table?

Would they build differently? Perhaps they would stop bringing along with them the strictures of their pasts. Perhaps there would be fewer office buildings and more cabins in the woods. More idyllic houses. More mountain landscapes and main streets of cute towns and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that no one knew about and yet which served the best curry, the best hot dog, the best cupcakes that one could possibly imagine.

Would they live differently, love differently? Perhaps they would still pair up as always they had. Maybe, when they get a crush on someone, they would fork to have a separate relationship with them as well. Maybe collectives of families would live together as they always had, finding comfort as much in each other as in their chosen relatives. Maybe a taboo would grow around having a relationship with oneself, of forked instances living together and loving each other. Would that be narcissism forever, or only before individuation? Would it be incest?

Would they chose life? Choose death? Would they pray?

She knew that it would happen, of course. She shared none of Yared's dread, of his pessimism. This was fine. She was the politician, he was the puppet. He would handle the pessimism, her the optimism.

No, not optimism; surety.

The bill would pass, the System would secede, the station launch would go off without a hitch. The bill could not but pass, the System was bound to secede, and the station launch was as safe as could be.

Yared would upload, or he would not.

The DDR would care, or it would not.

Earth would dream of them, up there on the System, or it would not.

The only thing, the only important thing, was to ensure continuity. A continuity borne of safety, of stability, and of an intense desire not to let the System come to harm. It had to be desired, prized, cherished by all those who stayed behind.

As she ruminated on this, the need to be desired as a form of stability, a memory bubbled up to the surface, spun around once, twice, and then came into focus.

A memory: \emph{``Two thirds of our power structure still thinks child restrictions are a good enough idea that those laws have bled into Russia, too.''}

Who had said that? One of the three, doubtless. They were so interchangeable.

She stepped into her apartment from wherever her thoughts had taken her, and she forked off a new instance, relying on that subtle trick that Jonas had taught her, letting her reputation stay pinned to where it was.

``I suppose that makes me Do I Know God After The End Waking.''

She nodded.

``Someone had to wind up with the name with a typo in it, alas.'' The other skunk smirked.

``Everyone gets something, yes,'' True Name said, plucking the dandelion from behind End Waking's ear and leaning forward to add it to the one already behind hers. ``Let us start with some differences. I do not want you looking too much like me, so that we can work separately.''

End Waking nodded, thought for a moment, and then forked several times in quick succession to lead to greater and greater differences, until a new Odist stood before her, new in all ways. Masculine, kind-faced, dressed in a business-casual outfit that retained both the competency and friendliness that Praiseworthy had helped her attain.

``If you think this is acceptable, we can start strategizing.''

True Name nodded, and the two skunks walked to her office.

``So, if we are to follow the timescale that Life Breeds Life suggests, what are some good milestones that we can set for ourselves?''

``I was thinking that it would be nice to have uploading incentivized within fifty years. That would mean that by the hundredth anniversary of Secession, we would primarily be seeing uploads who knew nothing but that idea.''

End Waking nodded. ``Probably best to begin as early as possible, yes, at least in terms of planning. I think that ensuring that the failure rate is below one percent within ten years would be good first step, followed by reducing the cost of upload by half ten years after, then half again in another decade. That gives us twenty years to work with when it comes to getting to a point of incentivization.''

``Alright, that sounds good. I will leave you to it, for the most part. I do not expect that there will be any news for another few years.''

The other skunk laughed. ``Of course.''

``And, End Waking, a favor.'' When he nodded, she continued, ``There are inquisitive minds. Always are. We already have Life Breeds Life helping on that front, but while you were talking through the timeline, I realized that it would be best if this conversation, these plans, didn't start, as far as anyone but you and me are concerned, until perhaps the 2150s.''

He tilted his head. ``How come?''

``I always find it surprising,'' True Name sighed. ``Just how quickly one can deviate from one's down-tree instance after all that forking.''

``Of course. You have been thinking your thoughts while I have my own.''

She nodded. ``Yes. We are quickly reaching the point where our efforts both sys- and phys-side happening all at once are reaching levels that might be considered uncomfortable in retrospect. If we can minimize our visible impact, then we should do so. Same date for the Council, same date for Jonas, same date for other Odists.''

``Mm, probably a good idea. I forked in 2143, then.''

``2143. Got it.'' True Name smiled. ``Thank you for this. I think it will work out quite well for us in the end.''
