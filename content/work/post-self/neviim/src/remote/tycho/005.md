# Tycho Brahe#Emissary --- 2346

Watching talks resume, starting to think y'know what, fuck it, maybe he'll just stay if allowed. Stolon's neat, the science is good, and having this to look forward to has given him more purpose in life. Interrupts talk to mention such regardless of glares from TN. Silence from Artemisians, one can assume internal chatter, then "that was the final gating step - wanting to join. We will welcome you as fifthrace" - from there they will learn all they want, have X days to do exchange, share entire libraries back and forth on data band, can keep format however they want on Castor. TN FROWNS but WHATEVER FINE
