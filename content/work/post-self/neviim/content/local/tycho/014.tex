\chapter{Tycho Brahe â€” 2346}\label{tycho-brahe-2346}}

Fresh out of talks, merges back with \#tracker in sim, looks up at the sky, new big feelings, TN shows up w/champagne. She's kind of sad, but guess it went okay, says she's trying to be earnest about just wanting to have something to celebrate with someone else, but isn't sure she knows how anymore. Cracks showing as growth collides with eternal memory.

Do you know how old I am, Tycho Brahe? I am two hundred twenty-two years old, a fork of an individual who is two hundred fifty-nine years old. I have learned many habits, and I have forgotten many others. We may retain our memories of concrete events, of who we must have been, but I am no longer the True Name of 2124. Even remembering her feels like remembering an old friend. I remember her perfectly, and yet I do not remember how to be earnest. I do not remember how to simply celebrate. I do not know how to simply be.
