\chapter{Codrin Bălan\#Artemis — 2346}\label{codrin-bux103lanartemis-2346}}

Part way through a talk on languages (WAQ has learned a lot about this leading up to it), TN gets news re: AWNH (a fork enters the space, quits, merges - Artemisians like huh???), calls halt to meeting, preempts everyone getting news separately by announcing what happened, tries to gloss over the swap quickly (b/c of course she's planned), but Turun Ka speaks up, says that this is part of confirmation required. For what? Tune in next time\ldots{}
