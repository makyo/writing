title: Possible mashup of Exocortices and Post-Self ("Post-Self"? "Qoheleth"?)
---

The basic structure is in two threads: the plot from Qoheleth intertwined with the plot from Exocortices, with the shared theme of memory and forgetting. Dear can't forget RJ, RJ can't forget information while lost. The lost lead to tech required for uploading.

Also includes short stories: Apres un reve, Gallery Exhibition. More? The poem?

Includes appendix about both threads.
