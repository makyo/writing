<p class="binderItem"><strong>Shutting down the theater</strong><br/>"Alright, everyone, it's midnight, time to start packing up," Johansson called.  "Ross, we're short one, can you start pulling together all of the mics?  RJ will help you get them sorted."<br/>
"Mmm," RJ offered through the sound system.  Ey was busy putting the theater to bed, and couldn't spare more than a meager few syllables to the rest of the cast and crew, though ey knew that ey'd need to help Ross out.  "Get a headset, Ross, so I don't have to talk through the speakers."<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>In the Crown Pub</strong><br/>AwDae sat up from bed and moved to the edge of the mattress, stretching languidly and letting eir fur bristle from tip to tail, the latter bottle-brushing out in the process.  Ey shook emself to settle eir fur back down and yawned widely, slender pink tongue curling and just shy of sharp incisors.<br/>
Brushing eir fur down, ey stood languidly and ambled over to the dresser in the corner of the room, pulling out a thin white cotton shirt with laces up the front and a simple navy sarong, which ey tied...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Going to bed</strong><br/>As RJ slid eir hands from the pads and leaned back from the headrest, ey let out a full-fledged yawn, startling even Priscilla across the room with the sound and the stretch.  Ey stumbled up out of eir seat and over toward the still-purring cat, stroking over her ears once more as she butted her head up against eir hand, eir mind whirling with a mix of work, of Cicero's disappearance, and of school with Sasha.<br/>
"I'm wiped, Prisca," ey informed the cat, who simply purred louder.<br/>
Smiling, ey peeled...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A late night at the office</strong><br/>Doctor Carter Ramirez rubbed her face into her hands, ground her palms against her eyes until she saw stars, before finally slicking her hair back.  She had put it up into a bun earlier that day, but there were plenty of flyaway hairs, as there always were.<br/>
She felt out of her league.  Everyone did, here on her team, but that didn't stop the fact from wearing on her.  It's not that there was no support from on high to help with the Lost, because there was.  It's not that there was no one else tr...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A hunch about furries</strong><br/>The morning's alarm startled her awake.  She had thought that the end of grad school had meant the end of six-hour nights of sleep, but apparently, that had not been the case.<br/>
Blearily, she pawed at her phone until she managed to swipe in the right direction to turn the alarm off.  It was tempting to go back to bed - after all, the Lost weren't going anywhere, she mused - but she managed to at least kick her feet out from under the covers and sit up.  in bed, letting her frizzed hair hang down a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Research on Cicero</strong><br/>RJ allowed emself to sleep in until nearing eleven that morning, given that tonight was the last night of dress rehearsals.  Many other members of the troupe held part time jobs during the day, and ey had been known to offer their services as consultant during times like these.  Even so, with all that ey did, ey made enough to not have to worry about holding down more than the one job<br/>
As it was, on days when they had nighttime rehearsals, ey felt no compunctions about sleeping in.  There was not...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Rehearsal, things go sideways</strong><br/>By the time ey left eir flat, it was about four in the afternoon.  Ey had spent a few minutes getting their suit brushed out and clean as best as ey could before putting it on, along with eir nice pair of gloves.  Thankfully, the suit jacket as already spotless, and the dress shirt would go through the laundry without problems.  It had been a stressful thought, that they might have to get the thing professionally cleaned, and at great cost for same- or next-day service.<br/>
On the way back to the tu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Theater notices</strong><br/>The curtain went down the lights dimmed, and then, clear as a bell, a thin giggle filled the auditorium: the lead had laughed at a misstep right before the curtain.<br/>
"RJ," Sarai whispered into the silence of the theater's sim.  "Stay on cue, bud."<br/>
There was no answer, no apology or signal that a note had been made.<br/>
"RJ?"<br/>
"What's going on up there?" came Johansson's subvocalization through the director's channel in the sim.<br/>
"Something's wrong, boss, lemme back out and check up on RJ."<br/>
"Temporary c...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Waking up</strong><br/>Like a flame burning through celluloid film, the third curtain had signified a drastic change, slow enough to be observed and yet faster than ey could possibly hope to avoid.  The few tenuous touches on reality that held RJ into eir seat in the tech booth scorched and peeled away, and the pain spiked.<br/>
RJ lay on a tile floor, dirty and yellow.<br/>
The tiles were completely regular, one foot on a side, and obviously made of some synthetic material.  They were simply glued to a concrete foundation with...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Emergency</strong><br/>"Something's not right, boss, he's totally unresponsive!"<br/>
"Pull him, pull him!  Hit the panic!"<br/>
Caitlin, who had backed out moments before, and Sarai both lept to RJ's sides and pulled eir hands up from the cradles in the way that they had been trained, rocking em back from the headrest to lean back against the back of the chair. Eir body flopped lifelessly against the cheap plastic mesh.<br/>
Caitlin slapped the small red button on the side of the monitor.  Her fingers came away dusty: rarely were p...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Lockers</strong><br/>Lockers.<br/>
The blue rectangles were lockers.  The first hint were the vent slots a few inches from the bottom of each narrow rectangle, but, as ey lifted eir muzzle from where it lay on the tile floor, ey could clearly see the locks halfway up each door.<br/>
Tall, narrow lockers.  Blue.  The yellow tile floors.  The very scent, the very feel of the place.<br/>
AwDae tried to make all of this information fit in with the fact that ey was currently halfway between human and cross fox.  A cross fox dressed in ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Timebox</strong><br/>"Listen, Ramirez, I'm just not sure if you-"<br/>
"No.  Come on, Sanders, just hear me out."  Carter sighed and settled her weight against the edge of her desk, taking a slow breath to buy herself some time and organize her thoughts.  "I'm just saying that we ought to look into social connections between the patients so that we can see if there's some factor that's tying these occurrences together.  With that under our belt, we may be able to formulate a better theory of what's going on here, even ne...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Correlations</strong><br/>Carter pulled back out of the sim when her personal timer went off, fifteen minutes before the timebox was up.<br/>
Yawning and stretching, she made her way from her workstation to the small counter at the front of the old classroom.  She filled the electric kettle from the tap and set it on its base, letting it heat up as she scooped a few heaping spoonfuls of coffee and chicory into the coffee maker.  While she was in the sim, she had ensured that everyone else's workstation would have an alarm for...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Back at school</strong><br/>AwDae slowly picked emself up off of the floor, staggering to eir feet in the middle of a long row of lockers.  Ey hardly felt weak, but the shock to the system of being in the tech booth and theater sim, and then suddenly being back in high school was taking its toll on eir wits.<br/>
Ey swiped eir paw from left to right in front of emself to bring up the menu.  Only, no menu came up.  There was nothing in this sim, wherever it was.  Ey had no ACLs, and there was no global menu.<br/>
Beginning to panic, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>To the auditorium</strong><br/>The sim was startlingly complete.<br/>
In fact, the only thing that seemed to have changed was AwDae emself.<br/>
AwDae's curiousity had wone out, and ey had made eir way back to the school's auditorium, exactly as ey had left it all those years ago.  Trudging up the few steps toward the entrance, ey feared that it would be locked, but the door swung easily beneath eir paw, and eir nails clicked against the lower portion of the sound guard in the doorway, leading em into a dimly lit auditorium.<br/>
The house ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>A plan is formed</strong><br/>The pit revealed little.  There were twenty boxes set on a table in front of the snakehead.  Twenty receivers for wireless mics.  Twenty cables neatly velcroed together into a bundle, contracting from the boxes and expanding once more toward the dull grey plug box.  From there, the cables were reduced to a simple five-per-row organization, arching up from the snakehead before bowing under their own weight, each a graceful arc.<br/>
All of the boxes on the table were dull, mute LEDs simple bumps on th...</p>

The first hour was spent searching the auditorium thoroughly.  Ey searched by walking around clapping and humming, then singing songs half-remembered from productions ey had helped with in the past.  Ey would've whistled if it wasn't for the structure of a canid muzzle.  There was no way eir lips would manage to pull that off.<br/>

After an hour, venturing even into the overhead areas where sound wouldn't reach, ey gave up and took a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Plans</strong><br/>Carter hadn't meant to dodge her subordinate's question.  They truly did need to go in to eat.<br/>
The food was, as promised, delightful, and Carter made a mental note to come here more often for more good Vietnamese food.  That note, however, was filed by her mind and set aside so that she could work through the implications of what had been spilled to her by the tabloid.<br/>
She couldn't visit this RJ any more than she could fly out of the second story window here and back to her lab.  There were seve...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Thoughts on Sanders</strong><br/>With her resolution planted firmly within her, she found it much harder to make it through the rest of the day.  Rather than wrangle the two competing strands of the work group into some cohesive goal, she spent much of her time distracted.  She was thinking about all of the ways in which she could possibly approach the cast or crew.  Would she be able to even get in contact with any of them?  Supposing she would, what would she even say?  "Tell me about your sound tech"?<br/>
Eventually, though, the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Meet with Johansson</strong><br/>The play was a contemporary piece called The Short Trip.  According to the season, it chronicled an indecisive youth taking a small trip away from his family on false pretenses to visit a bunch of friends for three days.  The goal of the trip was to visit his long-distance partner, but in the setting of a party, with guests, both known and unknown, weaving their way through the scene over the three heady days.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sleeping arrangements</strong><br/>Sleep did not come easily.<br/>
Auditorium seats, although padded, were not made for laying down on, and AwDae found that ey had to face toward the backs of the seats, or else eir tail would get crimped against them.  At first, the faint dusty smell of the seat fabric had inspired nostalgia, but it didn't last long.  Eventually, ey got up blearily and began pacing around the auditorium, looking for some way to get some rest that did not involve the seats.<br/>
Ey pondered pulling down one of the curtains ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>In the pub with Johansson</strong><br/>Johansson's hands dwarfed the pint of ale.  Once they had managed to find each other in the post-theater rush of the pub, the'd managed to stake out a small two-top table, crammed against one end of the bar itself, leading the larger man to lean slightly to the side away from the noise coming from above it.<br/>
He'd hardly touched the beer, but it seemed to take on an almost talismanic significance to him.  Carter drank her own cider slowly, careful not to press her luck too hard.  Johansson seemed ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Outside</strong><br/>AwDae stood in the sunlight for a moment, blinking.<br/>
Ey felt weak.  Not from hunger, nor lack of sleep.  Just worn out, exhausted.  This was starting to feel like grinding: that drudge that you went through when playing some role-playing game in order to level up.  It was always cast in a negative light, but then, you could quit a game.  Here ey was, finding clues and all the nonsense that went along with gaming, and for what?<br/>
There was even a fog of war.<br/>
"So much bullshit,"  ey laughed bitterly....</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Getting ready</strong><br/>AwDae wound up in a simple, pleated skirt and a rather plain shirt.<br/>
The skirt fit well with a tail, certainly far better than having eir trousers sag beneath the base of the tail awkwardly.  It was a nice robin's egg blue, but otherwise undecorated.  After all, most decorations would get lost in the distance between the stage and all but the closest audience members.<br/>
The shirt was made for someone with broader shoulders.  RJ might have filled it out, but on the fox's slim form, it was rather bag...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Leaving school</strong><br/>The grey mist turned out to be a render distance.<br/>
Render distances were used to reduce the amount of work the computer had to do to render a scene in a sim.  If one was in the school, that was pretty simple.  Buildings were fairly easy, made up mostly of polygons with textures attached.  Of course, if you got close enough, those textures would be mapped to an artificial surface to give them more depth, causing the system to work harder, but that was rarely an issue.<br/>
Outside, though, that was dif...</p>
