Series of emails between son (Darren) and mom, Darren trying to figure out the best way to work with divorce for his children's sake. Climax is Darren getting snippy about how he's trying to do the opposite as his parents in his case, upset that he's repeating history by getting divorce in the first place, with mom admitting her worries about how she handled her own divorce and how it affected Darren, removing him from his father's life, saying she wish she'd split up earlier in his life.

Things to incorporate:

* Mom suggesting Darren visit with Dad in the past, despite previously poisoning that relationship (re: Jay)
* Marriage counseling including kids, and Darren's unhappiness with it, since it feels like a lack of honest communication between kids/parents, only between kids/counselor, despite the fact that communication between Darren/wife has broken down. (re: counselor I saw re: Jay/Paola)
