> She gets drunk, angry and blames him for soemthing another dog did to her years ago, and sprays him in a drunken fit ? Like say she was young and one picked on her and stuff in school, its why she is how she is currently. And because of this, it creates her personality complex, due to the hateful way she was treated by a dog, and Riley might have a superficial similiarty, like same speices.
