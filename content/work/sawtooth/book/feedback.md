Hey, I hope you don‚Äôt mind an out of the blue telegram.

I just finished reading Disappearance, and I really love it.

Madison Scott-Clary, [19.11.19 18:39]  
No worries~ And thank you so much! That means a ton to hear @.@

Fuzz Wolf, [19.11.19 18:52]  
You‚Äôre welcome. It just hit me in a lot of ways. I think everyone has probably had thoughts of just leaving their lives at times.

Madison Scott-Clary, [19.11.19 19:00]  
Yeah, that was sort of the source of it. The MC didn't really have a good, solid reason for it, and I don't think I have one for those kinds of dreams, but they're certainly there.

Fuzz Wolf, [19.11.19 19:04]  
I have even less reason than or Aurora or the MC did. My life is actually pretty good, considering it‚Äôs 2019 and all.

I just get mopey sometimes. And then, sometimes I think it would be nice to just get in my car and just start driving on the interstate.

Fuzz Wolf, [27.11.19 15:04]  
Just read You‚Äôre Gone. Fuck, that was good.

Obvious differences of course, but it made me think of my own grieving process after my mum died. Also cancer.

It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm okay now. She died in 2011. I still miss her, but goddamn that first couple of years was really hard.

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 15:23]  
Oh gosh, thank you. That was kinda brutal to write, even if it was cathartic. Went through a lot of similar processes when my friend died - still am - and yeah, it can really tear one up

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 15:23]  
Thank you, though. That means a lot to hear!

Fuzz Wolf, [27.11.19 15:25]  
I hope you‚Äôre in a better place now. Losing someone is so hard. I don‚Äôt think people realize that till it happens to them y‚Äôknow. It‚Äôs like a line in the sand of my life, the before and after.

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 15:30]  
Oh yeah, definitely better over time! Though it's hard to imagine a universe in which Sept 6 will ever be a good day :P

Fuzz Wolf, [27.11.19 15:35]  
I always get down around October 4th.

I was really depressed the week leading up to it this year and my husband doesn‚Äôt remember the exact date, but I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so down and I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

He asks ‚ÄúAre you sad about your mom?‚Äù

I look at the date, October 3rd.

He knows me so well.

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 15:59]  
Yeah, it's definitely a thing! I'm sorry to hear about your loss, though it sounds like you've done pretty well in moving on

Fuzz Wolf, [27.11.19 16:02]  
I have, yeah. The worst part was the feeling that it happened way too soon. I was 35, she was only 57.

I thought I‚Äôd be her age before having to deal with losing her.

Now I can fondly remember the good times though. I‚Äôm glad I made time for her, called her every day, took her on road trips. I had a great relationship with my mother and I‚Äôll always treasure that.

Mother‚Äôs Day ads are still tough to see all the time though.

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 16:23]  
Yeah, for sure.. I imagine it'll be tough when that time comes in my life, too, even if Mom and I aren't as close as that.

Thank you for sharing, though. There's a lot that goes into folks' lives you never really hear about.

Fuzz Wolf, [27.11.19 16:25]  
Among all the many reasons I love being a furry is how supportive everyone was during my mum‚Äôs illness and afterward. So many people reached out to support my husband and I. The community really meant a lot in a difficult time.

Madison Scott-Clary, [27.11.19 16:54]  
Yeah, this community has saved me several times over ^^ glad it's still around and going strong

Fuzz Wolf, [17.12.19 16:23]  
I want to visit The Book and the Bean. üìö

Madison Scott-Clary, [17.12.19 17:33]  
Yeah, I wanna meet Malina :D

Madison Scott-Clary, [17.12.19 17:34]  
Also thank you for catching that!

Fuzz Wolf, [17.12.19 17:38]  
[Respondo al Madison Scott-Clary]  
I‚Äôm on that story now.

I used to have some OCD things and the description of S√©l√®ne‚Äôs thought process as she checked the kitchen was starting to make me feel anxious. üòÖ

Madison Scott-Clary, [17.12.19 17:39]  
Rrrf, yeah, it's deeefinitely a thing <.<

Fuzz Wolf, [17.12.19 17:41]  
I used to do this thing where I‚Äôd have to click the door locks a certain number of times or I wouldn‚Äôt feel right.

I think that was during a pretty stressful part of my life. One day I kinda realized what I‚Äôd been doing and made myself stop. Feeling my chest get tight as I resisted.

You ever read a story that punches you right in the soul?

That's me right now. I think I'm emotionally down for the count this evening. Brain overloaded from too much to think on and feel.

Yeah this same story is still holding onto me pretty hard. I really dunno what to do here, therapy isn't till next week.

Not only do I have so much to think about now, but damn... I want to write something that powerful myself...

-----

Oh gosh, I had this happen with Nate Powell's Swallow Me Whole. Picked it up, and suddenly it was two hours later and I had a month's worth of thoughts to unpack. I'm still digesting it.

-----

First, checking that book out online it seems like something I want to add to my own reading list.

Second, I'm marveling that you of all people commented on this one. Seeing as how you happened to write what is so strongly on my mind!

-----

Wait omigosh @.@ Which one?

-----

Just finished up Restless Town, some of the stories struck a chord in a way I haven't felt in writing for quite some time. I've been pondering so much these past few days.

-----

Oh goodness! Thank you! It's really nice to hear that folks are reading it and finding it affecting!

-----

It absolutely was! In particular Disappearance and A Theory of Attachment were the heaviest hitters for me. I've got so much to figure out from them now.

Not that some of the others weren't just wonderful too. Centerpiece was just plain marvelous!

-----

Yay! I'm glad you enjoyed. It's been interesting seeing which stories different folks enjoy more :3

-----

I hope it gets in front of tons of eyes, honestly I'll be sharing it as a must read with my friends. Because honestly, not only did the stories hit me hard but I think I learned some things on how to improve my own writing!

You've got quite a brilliant mind :3

It seems strange to call a book 'gentle' when it comes with content warnings, but this collection earns the title with a series of introspective pieces in which thoughts and feelings are slowly and carefully explored.

I love furry slice-of-life, and I love stories set in and around a single location - and what author wouldn't like to visit coffee bar-cum-bookshop The Book and the Bean? Above all, I valued the sensitive, realistic portrayals of anxiety and depression. Sawtooth is a restful town as far as I'm concerned.

I should not be allowed to have books, nor have access to them.

I picked up a book FOUR HOURS AGO for a chapter before bed.
I just finished the entire book.

@makyo_writes is to blame for this, and for making me sob like a pup and worrying my dog.

Seriously though: Restless Town is great and I really enjoyed it!

Except the horrible breakdown that lasted for most of "You're Gone". A very well done read. Thank you.

-----

Oh noooo, the cursed "one more chapter"!

I suppose I should say I'm sorry/thank you! I hope it was net enjoyable? ^^

-----

It was very enjoyable, and my tear ducts needed a good rinse anyway. :^)

Thank you.

replied to a thread:
Well, each chapter can be so many years in the future! Sure you can put breaks into your short story, but there's only so many times people can see a short line between paragraphs and still follow.‚Ä¶
I read one that was all text messages. From a single person. It was amazing.

And conversely something like GOT would be nigh impossible as a short story.

Dwale  4:30 PM
Yeah, I mean, my short stories tend to have a lot of scene/time skips and no one's complained about them thus far. Other stuff, but not those. (edited)

I am about 100% sure we've read the same story and the author of it is in this chat

Dwale  4:31 PM
Mhm, GOT is an epic. I guess you could write a short story that was "epic" in a loose sense of the word, but can it really be an epic per se?

Makyo:fox:  4:32 PM
Love me a good ergodic story. Stet, Pale Fire, S..

Dwale  4:32 PM
Oh, all y'all talking about Makyo's interactive story with the texts?

Makyo:fox:  4:32 PM
(Granted I think only Stet is short...)

Linnea Capps  4:33 PM
I mean, I thought that was likely it x3

FuzzWolf:wolf:  4:33 PM
I enjoyed that one, although I read it in Restless Town so it wasn't interactive in that form.

Makyo:fox:  4:33 PM
Aw, yay!

Linnea Capps  4:33 PM
(which was excellent)

Dwale  4:33 PM
Yeah, it was a good story.

Makyo:fox:  4:34 PM
Gosh, thank you all .///.
