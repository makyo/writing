\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

As with any written work, there are many to thank who helped along the way. Thanks to Rob Baird for the boundless optimism and flattering words, as well as the inspiration from his Cannon Shoals stories; to Zeta for all her heart; and to JC and Robin for their help on reading and editing. Thanks, also, to Thurston Howl Publications, Sofawolf Press, and Red Ferret Press for working with me on three of these stories.

And thanks, of course, to the polycule. Just as each story here explores a different theme meaningful to me, each of you fills a different role in my life and make me all the more complete.
