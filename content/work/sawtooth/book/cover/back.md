*I just need out of this town. This stupid fucking town. This brown and flat and sad town. This restless town. This home to ennui and melancholy. This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the middle of an apathetic landscape like hay from an overturned truck.*

# Restless Town
A collection of ten furry short stories set in and around the town of Sawtooth, Idaho.

"Restless Town is an anthology about rebuilding. At its heart is grief, anxiety, and loss, and their intertwining with a life in transition. Itâ€™s a living heart, wrought into words."
