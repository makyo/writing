Mevrea applauds loudly!
Mevrea mafipulates, "Bipolar, type II."
Liska claps!
Maddy nod to Mevrea :3
Alvin has had depression. It sucks a lot.
Chipotle claps, and wrfs.
Alvin says, "Prozac is wonderful stuff."
Mevrea mafipulates, "People with type II don't often get diagnosed, or they get misdiagnosed, because between periods
    of depression they only... feel good. Really good. And feeling good is good, right?"
Maddy nod, crux of the story. Trying to write about it without it turning miserable itself is proving difficult.
Mevrea nods.
Enn says, "And with how rushed doctors are becoming, a proper diagnosis (or even being checked at all) is probably
    less likely."
Alvin says, "Well, it's better than it was. They used to not treat it at all. And people would kill themselves."
Mewse wakes up.
Alvin says, "Or people would fear the stigma of it and refuse to go see a doctor. And kill themselves."
Alvin says, "Or people would fear the stigma of it and refuse to go see a doctor. And kill themselves."               
Springbeast has been ridiculed for his issue, too
Enn says, "I wonder if a lot of the drug-addiction problem is a result of this."
Alvin says, "Or people would think taking medicine for a mental problem means they're weak and dependent, which is about as silly as a diabetic refusing to take insulin.""
Springbeast says, "a Diabetic refusing to take insulin if needed is soon a corpse. "
Mevrea mafipulates, "As is a person with major depression or bipolar disorder, all too often."                        
Mevrea mafipulates, "By their own hand, usually."
