title: Restless Town advance reader request

## Looking for readers!

Hi there! I'm looking for some advance readers for a short story collection that is coming out soon. I'm specifically looking for quotes on the back cover, if you enjoyed it! They can be anonymous, of course.

The deadline is unfortunately a little slim: I'd like to have the cover pulled together by the *10th of November* so that I can get the book approved and listed by the 15th --- about as late as I can manage to keep it within awards season. There are complicated reasons why I'm behind on my timeline for this, many of which are my fault, so I apologize in advance for that!

Length: about **66755 words**; about **290 pages**

## The book

Restless Town is a collection of ten furry short stories from the fictional town of Sawtooth, Idaho, exploring the themes of identity, sexuality, and mental health.

## Contents

* **The Fool** - A student and a motherly badger explore questions of identity through a tarot reading.
* **Disappearance** - A weasel attempts to escape from her life in Sawtooth to Oregon, but finds her old life still tied to home.
* **Fisher** - A fisher walks and hunts for meaning.
* **Centerpiece** - A couple heads to a BDSM play party where the wife will be the Centerpiece for the whole party to enjoy. With fertility already on the mind, will another mink showing up throw a wrench in things?
* **You're Gone** - A husband grieves the loss of his wife through instant messages.
* **Overclassification** - A chronically neat otter's life is thrown into disarray when she takes a homeless ringtail in from the cold.
* **Acts of Intent** - A coyote burns meaning into the world around him.
* **Every Angel is Terrifying** - Derek MacIver struggles to hold his life together through the ups and downs of bipolar disorder.
* **What Defines Us** - Darren and his mother struggle with the rammifications of the past repeating itself.
* **A Theory of Attachment** - Living with obsessive-compulsive disorder is tough without a support network, so when Sélène's changes, stress runs high.
