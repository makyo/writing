\chapter*{Introduction}

Michel-Vincent Corbeaux and I have been mutual followers of one another’s work for quite some time now. Indeed, we both like to feel that we function as parts of a loosely-associated small cadre of like-minded poets, who choose to embrace more traditional forms of rhythm and structure (though, truth be told, perhaps a great deal more religiously in Mr. Corbeaux's case, when compared to my own). Likewise, as Mr. Corbeaux has been a tireless advocate and promoter of my work, it’s only right that I at least attempt to return the favour.


Most of us feel that, especially in these days of traditional poetic forms mostly having become a dying-and-almost-forgotten art, it’s more important than ever for poetry to not forget those roots, perhaps even at the risk of being thought a dinosaur, and the ever-dreaded ‘out of step with the times’.


While a great deal of my own work often slides towards the maudlin and world-weary, Michel-Vincent Corbeaux often reminds the reader of the importance of trying to maintain a centre of optimism, no matter how dark the hues that optimism is ultimately painted with.


With all that said, I cordially invite the reader to explore and enjoy the works of Mr. Corbeaux, just as I have.
