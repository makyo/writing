\chapter*{Afterword}

I won’t lie, when Michel-Vincent Corbeaux approached me to write his afterword, I was both extremely honoured and intimidated. I thought, “Wait. Why me? What did I do to deserve such a task?” Now I feel very blessed for the opportunity. 


Our story begins in early 2021, when Mr. Corbeaux joined my online writers community, Wildside Literature. With his knowledge and strong devotion to poetry and the community, it wasn’t long until I approached him with the opportunity to become an administrator. Which he graciously took. As time passed, we grew closer, becoming good friends, and for that I am grateful. Together, in this short time, we have helped each other through thick and thin. 


Up until I left Wildside Literature mid 2022, it was such an honour working alongside Mr. Corbeaux. He has provided me and many others with much of his knowledge in poetry. All of which he did from the goodness of his heart and willingness to teach.


“From The Plume,” has given me insight on how although the world at times is dark, and in some moments there is no hope, our actions and decisions can allow us to see the light once again. There are beautiful lessons in life. Each day is a brand new journey for us all. And I am excited to see where Mr. Corbeaux carries himself on his journeys.
