I had my own surgery in 2018, and my therapist suggested I write about my experience anonymously so that she could share it with one of her other clients who was looking at going through a similar process. That she did so a year before I started writing this is neither here nor there.

Either way, While Justice's story closely follows my own in a lot of respects, it isn't 100% the same. It's the type of thing I'd like to be readable without losing any of the informative aspects. A lot of the process of going through surgery is incredibly recondite and awkward, and there's no escaping that. The goal of this project is, first and foremost, to tell a story, but a close second is to provide an example of what one can expect in going through this process. To that end, I hope it helps.
