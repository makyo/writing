\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
I bought my name fair and square;\marginnote{It cost about \$260.00.}\\
Bespoke, built from whole cloth.\\
I wrote it again and again,\\
Savoring every J,\\
Skipping every fifth tittle,\marginnote{Was going to go with Juniper, the tittle refers to that \emph{i}, not the one in Madison.}\\
Until it felt right,\\
Like sitting inside and watching the snow fall\\
\vin Through the window\\
Or finding the perfect way that branches in two trees\\
\vin Line up with each other\\
Or when the windshield wipers move\\
\vin In time with your music.

I built myself fair and square\\
With hands raw from coarse identity.\\
I kneaded and pressed and squeezed,\\
Savoring every curve,\\
Skipping every tenth day,\\
Until it all felt right,\\
Like the sweet smell of pine bark\marginnote{Vanilla, for Ponderosa pines.}\\
\vin Rubbed between fingers\\
Or the whisper of maple leaves\\
\vin Under hurrying paws\\
Or the perfect overlap of new buds\\
\vin Already sticky with sap.
\end{verse}
