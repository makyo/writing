\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
Every time I fall,\marginnote{A rewrite of a cut-up poem from 2004.}\\
\vin The ground tells me I'm in love.\\
``'Cause love is\\
\vin All low,'' it says.\\
``And loves is\\
\vin Places.''

And I always argue,\\
\vin That love is all people.\\
That love is dogs,\\
\vin And cats.\\
And love is\\
\vin Emotions.

But every time I fall,\\
\vin The ground tells me I'm in love.\\
That gravity is\\
\vin Some awkward embrace,\\
And love is\\
\vin Permanence.

And I always argue,\\
\vin That love is temporary.\\
That that's\\
\vin The beauty,\\
And permanence\\
\vin Misses the point.
And every time I fall,\\
\vin The ground tells me I'm in love.\\
And every single time,\\
\vin I keep coming back.
\end{verse}
