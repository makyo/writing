\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  Too many wine-dark seas\marginnote{Homer: \emph{oinops pontos}} need daily traversal,\\
  And here the shipping forecast calls for rain.\marginnote{The Met Office issues a radio weather forecast for ocean-going vessels, with winds and weather described by a strict format. Also, the song \emph{Heligoland} by Overseer.}

  The shipping forecast! What a load of bollocks.\\
  You can listen from start to finish\\
  And not hear a single word about how a day will feel.

  Or maybe it's a pale, tired, steganography:\\
  Moderate, becoming poor, violent storm 11.

  Burning up, drowning, torn by wind, and all I can manage\\
  is to tell you southwest gale 8 to storm 10.

  I can point at the moon, exhausted, bored, decaying,\\
  And hope you don't stare blankly at my finger.\marginnote{Often misattributed to Bodhidharma, though more often a Zen saying referring to the teachings, which are a finger pointing at the moon.}
