\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  You get to explain gender to all of your friends ---\\*
  \vin And all of your family ---\\*
  \vin And maybe once more to be sure ---\\*
  \vin And random strangers ---\\*
  \vin And maybe, like, doctors and nurses who should probably know better;

  You get to explain to your partner that nothing has changed ---\\*
  \vin And that you were always this way ---\\*
  \vin And that really, honestly, nothing has changed ---\\*
  \vin And that this has no effect on your love for them ---\\*
  \vin And I promise;

  You will get to come out again ---\\*
  \vin And explain that it wasn't that being gay wasn't enough ---\\*
  \vin And explain that it has nothing to do with who you like ---\\*
  \vin And explain that that shouldn't matter ---\\*
  \vin And -- oh right, this means you might be straight after all;

  You get to go through that awkward period of growing your hair out ---\\*
  \vin And learning how to ask for a more feminine haircut ---\\*
  \vin And trying a curling iron for the first time ---\\*
  \vin And figuring out how to eat noodles without also eating your hair ---\\*
  \vin And the worries that you're just trying to be rebellious;

  You get to worry whether you're maybe just trying to be rebellious ---\\*
  \vin And whether or not you might just be faking it ---\\*
  \vin And whether you're really Trans Enough or not ---\\*
  \vin And whether you're maybe just appropriating femininity ---\\*
  \vin And whether or not passing really matters to you anyway;

  You get to dress up in your best clothes ---\\*
  \vin And your best makeup ---\\*
  \vin And worry that your shoes are too masculine ---\\*
  \vin And have your hair game on point ---\\*
  \vin And convince the doc that you deserve those patches and pills;

  You get to go through puberty again ---\\*
  \vin And it will be weirder this time around ---\\*
  \vin And your skin will grow soft ---\\*
  \vin And you'll get more sensitive to temperature changes ---\\*
  \vin And -- YEOWCH! That's a new sensation;

  You will cry a lot ---\\*
  \vin And bite your tongue often ---\\*
  \vin And lower your gaze ---\\*
  \vin And learn to take up less space ---\\*
  \vin And talk softer;

  And your dogs will still love you.
