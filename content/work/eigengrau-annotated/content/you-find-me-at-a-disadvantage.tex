\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  On reading letters late received,\\
  I felt within: the fox ---\marginnote{Let's just say that every em-dash is inspired by Emily Dickinson.}\\
  Yelping, yowling now, crying needfully ---\\
  Myself, a craving beast.

  You find me at a disadvantage ---\\
  Panting and aswish ---\\
  Would that distance be traversed as easily\\
  As hearts t'wards yearning hearts!
\end{verse}
