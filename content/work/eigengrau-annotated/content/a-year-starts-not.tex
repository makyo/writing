\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
A year starts not on January first.\\
\vin The days may hunder but the seasons speak\\
of time's long march, of fast time, slow time. Thirst\\
\vin for ``start'' and ``end'' neglects the limen sleek.\\
So, why do some unsubtle sciences\\
\vin forget about the in-betweens? Those pure\\
uncolored dreams made mere contrivances;\\
\vin ``between the years'' now simply: ``year, then year''.\\
These rough mechanics, held unseen, can spoil\\
\vin the beauty of our silent spaces, take\\
from us the liminality, embroil\\
\vin our lives in cold and tired minutiae.\marginnote{See \emph{Heligoland}.}\\
\vin \vin Come sit with me, come stay with me inside\marginnote{The rituals from a local pagan community have the call-and-response: "And so we find ourselves in a place between."}\\
\vin \vin this place between where strange new loves abide.

They sat together in silence for a while.

``There's something about the liminal that terrifies me.''

\hfill ``Me too,'' she said\ldots{}
