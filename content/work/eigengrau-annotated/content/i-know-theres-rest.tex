\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
The eighteenth whisker on the left is brown.\\
\vin I know this after countless nights awake\\
beside you, watching every quiet breath:\\
\vin You puff your whiskers out on every yawn.\\
On longer work-filled days, your whiskers wilt,\\
\vin exhaustion softening your features, sleep\\
exerting subtle gravities to lead\\
\vin you to oneiric\marginnote{Oneiros, the personification of dreams.} seas and dreamlike sands.\\
I know this after countless nights awake.\\
\vin I know, I know, it's strange to watch you sleep,\\
but when I can't, to know that someone can\ldots{}\\
\vin at least it somehow lets me rest in turn.\\
When I lay beside your sleeping form\\
\vin I know there's rest to still be had for me.
\end{verse}
