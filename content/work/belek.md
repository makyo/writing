title: Belek Oorzhak

### Description

Belek Oorzhak is a cat from the mountains above the steppes. Their pelt is thick in a mottled grey, though when the light is right, some of the splotches look a bit brown, the better to blend into the rough granite of the area. There's little enough that can actually be seen of that, though, as the cat is garbed from head to toe in clothes that have seen better days, but are certainly tough and functional. They also serve to obscure Belek's form, loose enough to keep them from being easily identified. This ambiguity extends to their voice, a solidly androgynous sound that can pass as masculine or feminine. It's all carefully constructed to let them put on an appearance and then later drop it so that they can become someone else, befitting a charlatan.

### Backstory

Belek takes odd jobs here and there in order to support themself, but the concept of payment is a slippery one with them. Although they're rarely an outright grifter, what they receive is not always what was bargained on at the beginning of the ordeal.

The origin of their warlock nature springs from this. They were hired to help move the khiidiin nomyn san, the monastery library, from its old building to the newly constructed one. Part way through the process, on seeing the fineness of the books, they requested that they "simply be paid in knowledge, as this is a fine endeavor." Upon further discussion, it came out that they were interested in taking a book, "as I must move on to travel to my next job." They picked out a book, and the librarian monk was more than happy to let it go. This was the first part of the deal; the second was completed and the deal sealed when they finished reading the book, after which everything changed for them. The monk, it turned out, had completed his part of the bargain and wanted to forget all eldrich things, and the best way to do so was to lose the book.
