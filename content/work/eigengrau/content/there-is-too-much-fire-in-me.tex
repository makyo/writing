\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
  There is too much fire in me \\
  to be described by the soldering iron's tip.

  If I were to draw that across my flesh,\\
  \vin it would all spill out at once.\\
  I'd melt, eaten whole by flames,\\
  \vin and flow into a pool of molten silver.\\
  I would be borne up through the clouds,\\
  \vin and grow lighter by the second.\\
  Sublimation would claim me then,\\
  \vin atoms would scatter, diffuse.\\
  All that energy poured to the air around me,\\
  \vin an imperceptible increase in temperature.\\
  Particle would excite particle\\
  \vin until I'm felt only as warmth on your face.

  But even that would not be enough.
\end{verse}
