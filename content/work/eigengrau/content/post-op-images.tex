\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
When I am asleep,\\
The world changes around me.\\
In spring, I am changed.

\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
I'm no good at images, only words,\\
and yet for days after surgery,\\
as anesthesia and countless\\
\vin milligrams, milliliters, millions of\\
drugs leave my system,\\
I'm lousy with visions,\\
each lousy with meaning.

I lay in bed, unable to move,\\
struggling to keep my eyes open;\\
I know that if I close them,\\
\vin I'll be lost, I'll be lost, I'll be\\
mired in waking dreams,\\
coherent visions with all the logic\\
of that paler side of consciousness.

Perhaps the veil here\\
is still too thin and vague,\\
the pool too clear, the monsters too scary\\
\vin too lean, too mean, too hungry, or\\
perhaps I was too close to death\\
to come away totally unscathed,\\
too close to completely survive.

\vin It's as though, laying here,\\
\vin stinking of hospital,\\
\vin I'm seeing emotions play out,\\
\vin \vin Scene after scene, scene after scene,\\
\vin anxiety shown in heaps of discarded entrails,\\
\vin hope in the ceaseless ratcheting of gears,\\
\vin determination in the marching of feet.

If I were an artist, perhaps\\
I could hope to touch these images,\\
but as it is, every word falls short,\\
\vin too vague, too inexact, too tight to\\
hope to explain something so vast\\
by the very act of attempting to reproduce;\\
I can only hint from the margins.

That poetry can accomplish what prose cannot\\
in its economy of motion\\
is attractive to me, here in recovery ---\\
\vin so tired, so tired, so tired --- so\\
maybe I can hope to express the dire import\\
of these visions dancing behind closed lids,\\
or at least remind myself on rereading.

\newpage

\vspace{0.01em}

Even now, a week out,\\
I'm starting to lose touch with the visions,\\
I can almost touch them if I squint,\\
\vin lie real still, don't move now, but\\
even then, a shadow of the substance\ldots{}\\
I'm starting to consign to memory\\
that which was probably memory to begin with.

\begin{verse}[1.01\textwidth]
It is two hundred miles between what I expect and what I want.\\
Two hundred long strides that seem impassible from one direction,\\
\vin and from the other a day's short drive.

It is nine and a half hours between question and answer.\\
A half hour of jazz, nine hours of sleep, a scant second of perspective,\\
\vin and I can only traverse in one direction

It is eleven inches between who I was and who I am.\\
Ten of those inches are pain, the eleventh is numb,\\
\vin There's pleasure to be had in there, I'm promised.

It is twelve years between what I want and what I get:\\
Ten years of remembering who I will become, two years running,\\
\vin Eight days dreaming.
