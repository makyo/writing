\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  Though the flow’r may bloom ere long\\
  \vin and night recede unto the dawn,\\
  so yet may love’s embrace grow fond\\
  \vin and still be spoilt upon the wan.\\
  Brave are you and wield your smile:\\
  \vin A cudgel, tool, a keen-edged blade.\\
  You are not wan, love is not spoilt;\\
  \vin thus I be slain and love not fade.\\
  Have I any need for flow'rs?\\
  \vin For nights, for dawns, for words or breath?\\
  With so keen and fond a blade,\\
  \vin There's naught to fear in life or death.\\
  \vin \vin So slay, then slay! For now, I care not how,\\
  \vin \vin I need for naught but that which love allow.
\end{verse}
