> Plz upload foxes.  Zero pressure.
>
> Seriously, how cool would that be? :3  Multithreaded, distributed foxes.  Infinitely useful.
>
> If you could fork a fox, what would you do with them?
>
> (per previous tweets, all instances would read about all other instances in a daily summary, you're not off scott free :P )
>
> Today on #postsingularityquestions: if a poly person is uploaded and forked to have multiple monogamous relationships, are they still happy?
>
> Ct'd: if they're reading their other selves' stories daily, is compersion enough to sate whatever passed for "innate polyness"?
>
> Which spawns two questions:
> 1. Are forks their own individuals?
>
> 2. Is there a condition that sates a mono fork of a poly personality?
>
> 3. Is it kosher for a mono fork of a poly personality to SIGHUP when a relationship ends?
>
> 4. In a pseudo-mono relationship, how much ought the partner know about metamours? How much is the poly's responsibility to disclose?
>
> E.g: is it irresponsible for a poly personality to form a mono relationship with a mono partner if the fork is monogamous?
>
> DAMNIT, this was supposed to be sexy...
>
> ... 5. If a jealous mono partner induces SIGHUP in a mono instance after finding out about poly core, are they guilty of murder or manslaughter?
>
> See #1, if they're their own people with irretrievable memories post termination, is that different than if the memories rejoin the gestalt?
>
> Listen.
> This started as the most efficient way to give the most blowjobs. Promise.

> *Indi:* @makyo_alopex Also is there a meaningful distinction to be made between merge and rebase?
>
> @IndiLatrani crap, and what if there are conflicts? Who types rebase/merge --continue?
>
> *Indi:* @makyo_alopex Maybe itâ€™s all pull requests reviewed by the target? Wait or maybe a consensus?
>
> @IndiLatrani two-thirds majority of :+1:S?

> Fox-instance leader-elections oh jeez I'm so lost
>
> Distributed foxes are a non-trivial problem..
>
> *Kyh:* @makyo_alopex one solution is to disallow mono..
>
> .@kyhwana that could only every be a guideline, given how romantic attachment has worked for me in the past.
>
> .@kyhwana oooh! Or maybe an instance rebels against that rule and gets in a mono relationship, what then?

### Other notes

* Can members of the gestalt opt out of future merges? Both receiving and giving? Effectively becoming their own person? If we go this way, it should be morally ambiguous so we don't make a claim one way or the other towards or away from plurality
* Instances meeting up for double dates?
* This almost makes more sense as a collection of stories like *I, Robot* rather than as a single story:
    * Secession of individual
    * Death and merging
    * SIGHUP after a relationship ends
    * Mono vs. poly
    * Just make it an open universe with a set of rules for authors to follow and characters to use?

-----

* Act 1
    * Exposition of how the universe works, some minor problems solved
* Act 2
    * Core problem exposed: we don't know how much weight to give individual instances in a poly relationship
* Act 3
    * Core problem comes to a head: confrontation b/w other instances/master branch with the murderer(?)
