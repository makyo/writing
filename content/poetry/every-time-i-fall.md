title: Every time I fall
---

<pre class="verse">
Every time I fall,
    The ground tells me I'm in love.
"'Cause love is
    All low," it says.
"And loves is
    Places."

And I always argue,
    That love is all people.
That love is dogs,
    And cats.
And love is
    Emotions.

But every time I fall,
    The ground tells me I'm in love.
That gravity is
    Some awkward embrace,
And love is
    Permanence.

And I always argue,
    That love is temporary.
That that's
    The beauty,
And permanence
    Misses the point.

And every time I fall,
    The ground tells me I'm in love.
And every single time,
    I keep coming back.
