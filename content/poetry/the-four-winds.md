<div class="verse">
I.
Borne through air,
    Close my eyes.
Wind ruffles hair
    Soul sighs,
    Heart flies;
I’m the wind.

I flow east:
    Over the plains,
Over land creased.
    Current refrains,
    Cloud stains
As I build.

Trees bow at my
          Will
To move drives me
          Onward
I push through
          Mountains
Do nothing but
          Divert
The rain as I
          Flow.


II.
Borne through air -
    Rise up high -
Driven there,
    Earth nigh,
    I sigh;
I’m the wind.

I flow west:
    Past the lakes,
Water my guest;
    Thunder makes
    Noise, wakes,
As I storm.

Sand flies at my
          Force
Builds as I
          Push
Across the
          Land
Flows beneath my
          Self
Means nothing to
          Wind.


III.
Borne through air,
    Through the night
And dawn fair.
    No fight,
    Only flight;
I’m the wind.

I flow south
    On the ocean,
On delta’s mouth
    My motion
    Just notion
As I breathe.

Waves break as I
          Drive
Past the thin
          Sands
Lift themselves to my
          Body
Waxes as I
          Press
Through the stillness of
          Night.


IV.
Borne through air,
    Around the world
And forests I tear;
    Ferns furled,
    Trees burled;
I am the wind.

I flow north,
    Across the ice;
I roll forth
    Past spice –
    So nice –
As I change.

Men bask as I
          Warm
Drops of rain
          Fall
Colored leaves
          Shiver
Because of the
          Chill
Wind blows on
          Past.
