title: Fair and Square
---

<div class="verse">
I bought my name fair and square;
Bespoke, built from whole cloth.
I wrote it again and again,
Savoring every J,
Skipping every fifth tittle,
Until it felt right,
Like sitting inside and watching the snow fall
    Through the window
Or finding the perfect way that branches in two trees
    Line up with each other
Or when the windshield wipers move
    In time with your music.

I built myself fair and square
With hands raw from coarse identity.
I kneaded and pressed and squeezed,
Savoring every curve,
Skipping every tenth day,
Until it all felt right,
Like the sweet smell of pine bark
    Rubbed between fingers
Or the whisper of maple leaves
    Under hurrying paws
Or the perfect overlap of new buds
    Already sticky with sap.
