The undersides
        off gray
    of clouds
    drift
        while I
            on the path
        stand
    above
        where the crow flies
    me.
Off
        with purple
    gray, I
        wandering
    ponder, should
        in a perfect
            were there such a thing
        world
    be a
        though the word is plain
    color with it's own
        to name
            as they say
        creates
    word.
It soothes.
