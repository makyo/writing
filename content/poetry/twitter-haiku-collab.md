<pre class="verse">
Seven flies circle,
Trimmers chatter down the block:
The hum of summer.

I listen, silent, waiting,
Breathing in sun and out shade.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Scent of cinnamon
Light slips over the mountain
Cirrus clouds blushing.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Warm wind from the west
Sunlight pours across the plains
Cicadas singing

Four-hundred miles from home
This western land not my own
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Fig leaves like fingers
paw feebly through still hot air
and come up with naught.

Too early for fruit to droop,
we must wait past midsummer.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Blackbird headed south
Down to the hawks and kudzu
Six months 'til winter
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
Redbud and dogwood
feathers bursting from leaf-wait
in the deep of here

underneath cut mountaintops
up and down flooded culverts
</pre>

### [Tarith Averin](https://twitter.com/tarithaverin/status/1009877999217307653)

<pre class="verse">
A light sighing sound,
Wind slipping through leaf and wing,
The heat's brief respite.
</pre>

<pre class="verse">
A storm is coming
My ears perk at the crashing
It is almost here

The end of a season near
Fresh rain pours from the heavens
</pre>
