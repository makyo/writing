title: The Dogs Assure Me
---

<pre class="verse">
The dogs assure me:
There are volumes of meaning &mdash;
Life and death &mdash;
And time;
Past, present, future &mdash;
In the scent of a rotting fish left after the flood,
Or a trace of scat,
Or the coyote, long passed,
But not everyone reads poetry.

I'm not so lucky, all told:
The rich scent of meaning &mdash;
Heady, intoxicating &mdash;
Rises only from words
And the way you rest your hands on the table.
</pre>
