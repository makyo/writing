\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  There's some duality between sources of meaning,\\
  \vin Between the types of stories we use to back identity.\\
  It's not quite good \& bad or light \& dark,\\
  \vin Though I'm not yet sure just how to define it.

  Dad used to punish the dogs\\
  \vin by locking then in the basement.\\
  If he was really mad,\\
  \vin he'd toss then down there by the scruff.

  Mom moved me \& her dogs to a new house ---\\
  \vin moved us three days early during the divorce.\\
  Her dog punched my ex stepdad in the crotch the night before,\\
  \vin the nut-shot to end all nut-shots, \& our time there.

  Few things make me feel as deeply about life as parenthood,\\
  \vin even if it's just me caring for my dogs.\\
  Some reminders of that are intense enough to be raw, painful,\\
  \vin salt in the wounds of mortality, maybe, or the ache of maternal love.

  The meaning behind the story of me \& my dogs\\
  \vin comes with a story of its own, or maybe several.\\
  It's bound up in stories to come,\\
  \vin \& these stories nest infinitely deep.

  Remembering that \& shaping that,\\
  \vin It's a part of making the meaning in my life.\\
  This isn't better against worse,\\
  \vin it's not mom against dad.
  \newpage
  It's not a dichotomy at all, really,\\
  \vin now that I think about it.\\
  It's something subtler, comfortably complex, a topic of its own.\\
  \vin I guess it's just meaning \& self.
