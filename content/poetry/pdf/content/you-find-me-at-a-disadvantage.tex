\begin{verse}[\textwidth]
  On reading letters late received,\\
  I felt within: the fox ---\\
  Yelping, yowling now, crying needfully ---\\
  Myself, a craving beast.

  You find me at a disadvantage ---\\
  Panting and aswish ---\\
  Would that distance be traversed as easily\\
  As hearts tâ€™wards yearning hearts!
\end{verse}
