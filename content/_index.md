<img class="portrait" align="left" src="/images/headshot.jpg" /> **Welcome to the writing home and blog of Madison Scott-Clary!**

I am an author of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry living in the Pacific Northwest. My interests lie in the realms of furry fiction and non-fiction, collaborative fiction, and hypertextual writing. I am a member of the Furry Writers' Guild, and editor for several projects, fiction and non-fiction. You can read more about me [here](/about).

This site collects several of my written works, as well as blog entries that touch on several topics. When a new standalone work is posted outside of the blog, a blog entry often accompanies it, so feel free to follow the blog feed for pointers to new stories, non-fiction pieces, and poems, as well as works in progress! Looking for my [writing portfolio](//makyo.ink)?
