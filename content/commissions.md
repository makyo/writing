title: Commissions

Hey there! I'm looking to take on the occasional short story commission.

I am currently **open for one or two 1,000--5,000 word commissions.**

## Terms of service

### Credentials

* I work as a technical writer by day and an author of various things by night.
* I'm currently working on my MFA in creative writing from Cornell College.
* I've published eight books (three short story collections, three novels, a memoir, and a poetry collection with another novel on the way), edited a short story anthology for Thurston Howl Publications/Bound Tails Press, and helped organize a collaborative anthology. My list of publications is [here](https://makyo.ink/publications).
* I was editor-in-chief of \[adjective\]\[species\] for 7 years and of Hybrid Ink, LLC for 2 years.

### What you get and how

* You send me the form below, which contains requests for character descriptions, events and story ideas, and moods. If I like it, I'll choose it and get in touch with you.
* I come back to you with a short outline that we can workshop. Once we agree, you pay 50% (refundable).
* You'll then get a draft for approval, at which point you can make small changes --- rewrites will be $10 per 1000 words. At final approval, you pay the second 50% (non-refundable). 
* You get a final version of the story as a fully-typeset PDF, plus whatever formats you want for posting (ODT, Markdown, FA's BBCode, Google Docs, etc).

#### Licensing

* You are licensing me the use of your characters. They remain yours. I am licensing you the use of my writing. It remains mine.
* You can use, post, excerpt, whatever you want with the text. If you're going to use/post more than 50% of it in one place, you must credit me and link back to <https://makyo.ink> (obviously, I prefer if you credit me no matter what, but hey, I get why it might be impossible!)
* I get to post it at least on my Patreon, but if you'd like me to keep it off public gallery sites, let me know.

### Content

I reserve the right to turn down a commission request, but here's some ideas for what I will and won't do.

#### Things I'm good at

These are what you came to me for:

* Furry (natch)
* Character studies
* Introspection about oneself
* Interpersonal communication (good or bad)
* Relationships starting or ending
* Dreams, hallucinations, ungrounded interpretations of individuals and situations
* Providing a sense or sensation of why a character acts or feels the way they do
* Queer lives and relationships
* Intimacy and sensuality
* Off-screen/fade-to-black sex
* Light kink (BDSM, degradation, etc)
* Flowery prose
* Overly-flowery prose

#### Things I'm bad at

Please consider carefully if I'm a good fit before asking me to do these, but feel free to ask:

* Fast-paced action sequences
* Most anything to do with the military or police
* On-screen sex
* Hard sci-fi/fantasy (mostly due to space constraints)
* Fantasy kinks (mpreg, vore, unbirthing, etc)

#### Things I won't do at all

* On-screen non-consensual sex (if you want characters talking about it, ask)
* On-screen sex with minors (ditto, if you want characters to talk about it having happened, ask)
* Homophobia, transphobia, etc (ditto above)
* On-screen gore
* Copyrighted characters or settings, characters that aren't your own, or settings from media franchises (if it's a shared setting, ask)
* Anonymous commissions

### Pricing

Still interested? My pricing is pretty simple! I ask for $20 USD base price, plus $20 USD per 1,000 words. E.g: a 3,000 word commission is $20+(3×$20) = $80.[^pricey]

[^pricey]: Sound pricey? Here's the breakdown:

    * I write about 3,000--5,000 words an hour
    * I edit about 1,000 words an hour
    * Typesetting a project takes me about an hour

    This works out to about $20USD an hour. Groceries for two weeks for two people is about $250--300 USD. If I want to buy two weeks of groceries, that works out to 15 hours or 14,000 words, which is a novelette or three short stories.
