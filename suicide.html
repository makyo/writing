title: On Suicide
---

<p>On March 21st, 2012, I tried to kill myself.</p>
<p>It's amazing how such a simple statement of fact reflects (at time of writing), months of strange tension, slow recovery, and a whole lot of trying to understand what really happened. It's not a comfortable thing for anyone to discuss, but it's one of those things I need to discuss, need to get off my chest.  A little to much of what makes life meaningful for me now is wrapped up in that one night.</p>
<p><em>This subject is a huge trigger for me, and a good way to make me instantly feel bad; understand, if you're the same, that the whole thing is about suicide.  I apologize in advance.  It's one of those things I needed to write.</em></p>
